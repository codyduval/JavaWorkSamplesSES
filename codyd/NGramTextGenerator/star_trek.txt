			Star Trek V: The Final Frontier		
						
			FADE IN :

		1   EXT. DESERT - DAY

			Shimmering waves of heat. A flat, unforgiving landscape
			stretches to infinity. A storm of dust gathers on the
			horizon, small at first, increasing in size as it rolls
			toward us.

			SUPERIMPOSE :

								NIMBUS III
							IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE

			A withered tree is revealed f.g. with a rifle leaning
			against it.

			SUPERIMPOSE :

						"THE PLANET OF GALACTIC PEACE"

		2   EXT. DRY LAKE BED - DAY

			CAMERA PANS an arid expanse of scorched earth. J'ONN, a
			ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien race,
			toils beneath a blazing sun, his BACK TO CAMERA. He
			sinks an auguring device into the ground, drilling in
			vain for water. There are many hundreds of holes in the
			earth around him. He suddenly straightens and squints
			into the dust storm as HOOFBEATS fill the SOUNDTRACK.

		3   ANGLE

			J'onn releases his auguring device and hurries toward 
			his rifle.

		4   J'ONN'S POV (INTERCUT - SLOW MOTION)

			Horse and RIDER, dressed in a hooded cape, thunder
			toward him.

		5   BACK TO SCENE

			The CAMERA TILTS DOWN revealing J'onn's rifle as he
			cocks the weapon.

			He uses stones as ammunition, which slip from his hand
			and fall to the parched ground as he tries to load the
			rifle. He turns and points the gun as the Rider continues
			his approach.

		6   J'onn raises his gun as the Rider reins his horse to a
			halt ten feet short of him. The beast snorts and stamps
			its hooves impatiently while the Rider studies the
			frightened homesteader and removes a breathing apparatus
			from his mouth. Finally, he speaks.

							RIDER
					I thought weapons were forbidden
					on this planet.

			The Rider swings down from the saddle. He's tall,
			powerfully built beneath his dusty robes, his face
			shadowed by a hood. He indicates their bleak surroundings.

							RIDER
							(continuing)
					Besides, I can't believe you'd
					kill me for a field of empty holes.

							J'ONN
							(pathetic)
					It's all I have.

			J'onn sags under the futile weight of existence. The
			Rider approaches him without fear. It's all the homesteader
			can do to keep from sobbing.

							RIDER
					Your pain runs deep.

							J'ONN
							(sobbing)
					What do you know of my pain?

							RIDER
					Let us explore it together.

			The Rider collects himself and concentrates deeply. J'onn
			is immediately transfixed. He begins to tremble. Tears
			flood his dirty cheeks.

							RIDER
					(continuing; soothing tone)
					Each man hides a secret pain. It
					must be exposed and reckoned with.
					It must be dragged from darkness
					and forced into the light. Share
					your pain. Share your pain with
					me and gain strength from the
					sharing.
		
		6   CONTINUED :

			J'onn whimpers and cries out in anguish. Finally, the
			catharsis ends. J'onn sobs and rests his head on the
			Rider's chest. He opens his eyes and blinks in wonder 
			and amazement at the Rider as he comforts J'onn.

							J'ONN
							(as if reborn)
					Where did you get this power?

							RIDER
					The power was within you.

							J'ONN
					(trying to find the words)
					I feel as if a weight has been
					lifted from my heart. How can I
					repay you for this miracle?

							RIDER
					Join my quest.

							J'ONN
					What is it you seek?

							RIDER
					What you seek. What all men have
					sought since time began - ultimate
					knowledge. But to find it we'll
					need a starship.

							J'ONN
					A starship? There are no starships
					on Nimbus III.

							RIDER
					Perhaps I have a way to bring one
					here.

							J'ONN
					But how?

							RIDER
					Have faith, my friend. There are
					more of us than you know.

		7   CLOSE ON RIDER

			As he throws back his hood to reveal rugged charismatic
			features. He's bearded, his hair is shaggy. He has
			the piercing eyes of a zealot and, to our surprise,
			pointed ears. His name is SYBOK.
		
		7   CONTINUED

							J'ONN (O.S.)
					You're a Vulcan.

			Sybock nods and does something we've never seen a Vulcan
			do. He smiles. As he does, the first faint bars of
			the STAR TREK THEME well up on the SOUNDTRACK.

		8   CLOSE ON SYBOCK

			As he covers his smiling mouth with his hand.

		9   ANOTHER ANGLE

			Sybok stands by his horse, laughing.


			FADE TO WHITE

			
			FADE IN:

			SPACE

			MUSIC and CREDITS PLAY OVER a dazzling journey through
			the cosmos. Planets, stars and solar systems flash by.
			No doubt about it, we're in for a rousing Star Trek
			adventure. As the FINAL CREDITS appear, we TILT DOWN
			to a breathtaking shot of EARTH.

			CUT TO :

		11   EXT. YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK - CLOSE UP - A HAND - DAY

			TITLES CONTINUE OVER 

			The hand clutches at a sheer rock, groping for purchase.
			CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK eight
			hundred feet above the surrounding forest. He climbs up
			the face of El Captain without ropes, grommets or equipment.
			Just man against mountain. Using the cracks in the
			rockface for hand and foot holes, Jim Kirk struggles up
			the treacherous incline, one painful inch at a time. We
			hold our breath, afraid he'll fall.

			SUPERIMPOSE :

			"PLANET EARTH - YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK - STARDATE : 8454.1"

			END TITLES

		12   CAMPSITE BELOW

			DR. LEONARD "BONES" McCOY watches Kirk's progress through
			futuristic binoculars with mounting unease. From this
			distance Kirk resembles a small fly on a big wall.

								McCOY
					(muttering toward the mountain)
					"You'll have a great time Bones, 
					You'll enjoy your shore leave.
					You'll be able to relax."
					(lowering binoculars)
					You call this relaxing? I'm a
					nervous wreck.
							(a beat)
					If I'm not careful, I'll end up
					talking to myself.

		13   EL CAPITAN - KIRK

			He inserts the pads of two fingers into a narrow crack
			above his head. He exhales, focussing concentration.
			Kirk pulls himself up, balancing on a ledge barely an
			inch wide. Exhilarated, he pauses to admire the view.

		14   KIRK'S POV

			A breathtaking but vertigo-inducing HIGH ANGLE SHOT of
			Yosemite. This may be the 23rd Century but the park
			looks the same as it did three hundred years ago.

			There is a soft WHOOSHING SOUND and SPOCK suddenly rises
			INTO FRAME.

							SPOCK
					Greetings, Captain.

		15   WIDE SHOT

			Spock hovers in mid- air alongside the startled Kirk, kept
			aloft by means of levitation boots. His hands are clasped
			behind his back, typically Spock-like.

								KIRK
							(he gasps)
					Spock - What are you doing in
					this neck of the woods?

							SPOCK
					I'm flattered. Twelve hundred
					points of interest in Yosemite and
					you pick me.

			Spock doesn't take Kirk's hint to get lost.

							SPOCK
					I regret to inform you that the
					record for free-climbing El Captain
					is in no danger of being broken.

								KIRK
							(as he climbs)
					I'm not trying to break any records.
					I'm doing this because I enjoy it.
					Not to mention the most important
					reason for climbing a mountain...

							SPOCK
					And that is?

								KIRK
							(with a smile)
					Because it's there.

							SPOCK
					Ah, Captain?

								KIRK
					MM.?

							SPOCK
					I do not think you realize the
					gravity of your situation.

			Kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save himself.
			Beneath his feet, a mini-avalanche of rocks is dislodged,
			tumbling to the valley below.

								KIRK
						(glaring at Spock)
					On the contrary. Gravity is foremost
					on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make
					an ascent here. Why don't you go
					pester Dr McCoy for a while?

							SPOCK
					I believe Dr McCoy is not in
					the best of moods.

		16   CAMPSITE BELOW

			McCoy, still watching Kirk's progress, is getting angrier
			by the second.

							McCOY
							(grumbling)
					Goddamn..irresponsible...
					playing games with life...

		17   EL CAPITAN - KIRK AND SPOCK

			Kirk strains for the next handhold.

							SPOCK
					Concentration is vital. You must
					be one with the rock.

								KIRK
					Spock, I appreciate your concern,
					but if you don't stop distracting
					me, I'm liable to be one...

			And as Kirk reaches for the next crack, the ledge comes
			loose underfoot and he finds himself falling.

		18   ANGLE - SPOCK

			He dives after Kirk, firing boosters to increase his
			speed.

		19   ANGLE - KIRK

			Twisting and turning end over end as he hurtles downward.
			He thrashes at the air, unable to defeat gravity.

		20   CAMPSITE

			McCoy turns away, unable to look.

							McCoy
					Oh, my God!

		21   ANGLE - KIRK

			Dropping...dropping..the ground rushing up like a
			hungry mouth. A split second before impact...

		22   ANGLE - SPOCK

			The Vulcan swoops INTO SHOT. His powerful fingers grab
			Kirk by the ankle and jerk him upward in the nick of time

		23   CAMPSITE

			McCoy hasn't heard the expected splat. He turns to look
			and what he sees is:

		24   WIDE SHOT

			Kirk is suspended in air, bobbing upside-down at the
			end of Spock's arm.

		25   CLOSER KIRK AND SPOCK

			The top of Kirk's head is practically touching the
			ground. That's how close he came to being pizza. Kirk
			blinks in disbelief.

								KIRK
					Oh, God

							SPOCK
					Perhaps "because it is there" is
					not sufficient reason for climbing
					a mountain.

			Kirk dangles - undignified but lucky to be alive.

								KIRK
					I'm hardly in a position to disagree.

			McCoy is heard in approach.

		26   KIRK'S POV

			McCoy is seen upside-down.
 
								KIRK
					Hello, Bones. Mind if we drop in
					for dinner?

		27   EXT. DESERT OUTPOST - DAY

			The single outpost of civilization on this desolate world
			- a small, ramshackle village smack in the middle of
			nowhere, surrounded by high walls. A lone rider on
			horseback crosses the desert, headed for the outpost.

			SUPERIMPOSE :

						"PARADISE CITY - NIMBUS III"

			INT. SALOON - DAY

			A 23rd Century equivalent of a frontier saloon. Futuristic
			honky-tonk MUSIC. The patrons are rugged, unpleasant types.
			Klingons, Romulans, Andorians, you name it. Much drink
			and boisterous talk. Arguments. Fistfights. Two men
			play futuristic "pool" on a table filled with water.

		29   A SEXY CATWOMAN

			Dances atop of the bar, flicking her long striped tail and
			hissing seductively at her rowdy audience.

		30   ANGLE ON SALOON DOOR

			A STRANGER coming from outside approaches familiar
			western-style doors. But instead of swinging open like
			you'd expect, they WHOOSH apart automatically. The
			stranger steps into the bar and the doors WHOOSH back
			into place.

		31   WIDE SHOT

			Talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its
			attention to the newcomer. The stranger, seen only from
			the back, steps into the squalid bar. The Bartender jerks
			his thumb in the direction of the back room. The stranger
			crosses to the back room and disappears inside. Talk and
			noise resume.

			A VEIWSCREEN is revealed b.g. As the cloaked stranger
			passes through the room toward the back, we hear:

					TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
					...your dream can become a reality...
					the Paradise Inn...lots to choose
					from. We at the Paradise Inn
					attempt to create the closest thing
					to paradise in Paradise City, that
					is...

			INT. BACK ROOM

			The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face
			and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her
			name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold of
			the room, trying to adjust her eyes to the murky
			surroundings. She's a little nervous and a long way
			from home.

			The back room is a storage area for unwanted odds and
			ends. A ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air
			around. Two men are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends
			of a table. They're two busy drinking to notice
			Caithlin's entrance.

							CAITHLIN
					Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.

			The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his head
			in her direction. He wearily extracts himself from his
			chair and comes forward. He's a Terran (specifically,
			an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT. Thin and dissipated,
			alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of the diplomatic corps. He
			pats down his unruly hair and straightens his soiled suit.
			He gives Caithlin a tired smile and extends a limp hand.

							TALBOT
					Ah, yes. Our new Romulan
					representative.
							(continuing)
					Welcome to Paradise City, my
					dear, capital of the so-called
					"Planet of Galactic Peace." I'm
					St John Talbot, the Federation
					representative here on Nimbus III.
					My charming companion here is the
					Klingon consul, Korrd...

			Caithlin regards the hulking figure at the other end of
			the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a
			once-great warrior past his prime. He doesn't rise
			to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from a
			flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.

							CAITHLIN
					I expect that's Klingon for hello.

							TALBOT
					Won't you come in, my dear?

		33   EXT. PARADISE CITY

			J'onn clambers over a dune with determination. He aims
			his gun as Sybock and his mount ride majestically to the
			top of the dune and continue on, followed by Sybok's
			soldiers, a virtual army of ragged settlers - aliens of
			every different race, the poor and the downtrodden - united
			in their devotion to Sybok.

		34   INT. BACK ROOM - SALOON

							CAITHLIN
					Twenty years ago, our three
					governments agree to develop this
					planet together.

			Korrd pours a drink from a bottle into his cup.

							KORRD
					Hmmm...

							CAITHLIN
					A new age was born.

							TALBOT
				Our new age has died a quick death.
							(continuing)
					And the settlers we conned into
					coming here - they were the dregs
					of the galaxy. They immediately
					took to fighting amongst themselves.
					We forbade them weapons and they
					soon began to fashion their own.

							CAITHLIN
					Well then, it appears I've arrived
					just in time.

			Korrd looks confused.

							KORRD
					Mmmm...

			There are shouts from outside and the whine of a warning
			KLAXON.

			EXT. PARADISE CITY

			A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate.
			It suddenly gives way. CAMERA CRANES UP OVER the top of
			the arch to reveal Sybok's army on the threshold of the
			city. In their midst, towering majestically above them,
			is Sybok on horseback. He urges his mount forward. With
			quiet determination, he and his army pour under the arch
			and proceed up the main drag.

			Townspeople scurry for protection, anticipating an attack.
			Those who consider challenging Sybok are allayed by the
			crude weapons and intimidating looks of the followers.
			Sybok intends to take this town by show of force without
			having to fire a shot. And it looks like he'll succeed.

		36   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALOON

			Korrd, Caithlin and Talbot emerge to see what the hubbub
			is about. When they see the approaching forces, Korrd
			and Talbot immediately turn tail and run back inside.
			After a moment, Caithlin follows.

		37   INT. SALOON

			Korrd, fearing the worst, goes behind the bar and opens
			a bottle. He upends it and pours the contents down his
			throat. He prefers to die drunk.

			Talbot and Caithlin hurry to the viewscreen. Talbot
			moves to turn off the program being broadcast.

					TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
					....we have spared no expense to
					create the closest thing to....

			Caithlin and Talbot wait as a communications screen rises
			in front of them. The saloon doors are forced open. J'onn
			rushes in.

							J'ONN
					Get away from that transmitter!

			Korrd lifts his drink. J'onn grabs him; Korrd pushes back.
			CAMERA PANS to reveal two armed soldiers who grab Korrd and
			hold him. The KLAXON winds down to eerie silence as Sybok
			enters, observing the action. He is followed by several
			soldiers.

							SYBOK
					(appraising them one by one)
					Romulan. Terran. Klingon.
					Consider yourselves my prisoners.

							TALBOT
							(scoffing)
					Prisoners? We're already prisoners
					on this worthless lump of rock.
					What possible value could we be
					to you?

							SYBOK
					Nimbus III may be a worthless lump
					of rock, but it does have one
					unique treasure. It's the only
					place in the entire galaxy that
					has the three of you.

							CAITHLIN
						(to Sybok; boldly)
					I don't know who you are or what you
					want but I can tell you this: our
					governments will stop at nothing to
					insure our safety.

							SYBOK
						(with a smile)
					That's exactly what I'm counting on.

			On Caithlin's confused look..			

			CUT TO :

		38   EXT. SPACE - EARTH - SPACEDOCK

			Hanging in space like a big Christmas ornament. The
			big blue marble called Earth is visible in the distance.

		39   INT. SPACEDOCK

			A huge, cavernous area designed as a high-and-dry for
			space vessels. Among this warehouse of ships is the one
			we know best - U.S.S.ENTERPRISE; NCC-1701-A.

							SCOTTY'S VOICE
					U.S.S. Enterprise, shakedown cruise
					report. I think this new ship was
					put together by monkeys. She's got
					a fine engine, but half the doors
					won't open. And guess whose job it
					is to make it right?

		40   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			A meager repair crew lazily overhauls consoles and
			monitors. Some things work, most do not. One thing
			that does work is CHIEF ENGINEER MONTGOMERY SCOTT who
			looks up as COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER UHURA enters,
			stepping around cables.

							SCOTTY
					(grumbling to himself; as he rises)
					Borgus Frat.

							SCOTTY
					(continuing; grumbling to himself)
					"Let's see what she's got," said
					the Captain. And then we found out,
					didn't we?

							UHURA
					I know you'll whip her into shape,
					Scotty. You always do.

							SCOTTY
							(realizing)
					Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

							UHURA
					And I thought we were supposed to
					be going together.

							SCOTTY
						(indicating the ship)
					Oh, I cannot leave her now when
					she needs me the most.

							UHURA
					I had a feeling you would say
					something like that. So I brought
					us dinner.

			She holds up small modernistic food packs. Scotty takes
			one.

							SCOTTY
							(touched)
					Oh, lassie, you're the most
					understanding woman I know.

			The bridge light starts to flash red. An ear-splitting
			KLAXON SOUNDS.

							COMPUTER VOICE
					Red, Red, Red Alert. Red Alert.
					Red, Red, Red Alert.

							SCOTTY
							(exasperated)
					I just fixed that damn thing.

			A man enters in b.g. carrying a cable over his shoulder.

							SCOTTY
						(continuing, to man)
					Turn it off, will you?

			Two men look at the console with concern.

							COMMAND VOICE
					Red Alert. Red Alert. This is a
					Red Alert. Enterprise acknowledge.

			Uhura goes to her console, punches a button and responds.

							UHURA
					This is Enterprise. Identify 
					yourself.

							COMMAND VOICE
					Enterprise, this is Starfleet. We
					have a Priority Seven situation in
					the Neutral Zone.

							UHURA
					Stand by Starfleet.
						(signaling Scotty)
					Scotty, this is for real.

							SCOTTY
							(aghast)
					They can't be serious. The ship's
					in pieces and we've less than a
					skeleton aboard.

							UHURA
					Starfleet, are you aware of our
					currant status?

							COMMAND VOICE
					Currant status understood. Stand
					by to copy operational orders and
					recall key personnel.

			Uhura and Scotty share grim looks.

		41   EXT. EARTH - FOREST - DAY

			COMMANDERS SULU and CHEKOV tramp through dense woods.
			From their weary expressions it's clear they've been
			hiking a long time. Sulu leads the way. Chekov trudges
			behind him.

							CHEKOV
					Admit it. We're lost.

								SULU
					All right, we're lost.
							(with a smile)
					But we're making good time.

			Sulu's communicator BEEPS.

							UHURA'S VOICE
					Commander Sulu, come in, please.

								SULU
					I don't believe this.
						(flips it out)
					Commander Sulu here.

		42   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE (INTERCUT)

			Uhura studies a monitor showing Sulu and Chekov as two
			blips on a grid.

							UHURA
					Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's
					been cancelled.

							CHEKOV
							(with relief)
					Rescued at last.

							UHURA
					Return to prearranged coordinates
					for pickup.

			Sulu and Chekov look at each other.

							CHEKOV
							(whispering)
					Don't tell them you're lost. You'll
					never live it down.

							UHURA
					Is there a problem, gentlemen?

								SULU
					Um... yes. We've been caught in
					a blizzard!

							CHEKOV
						(playing along)
					And we can't see a thing. Request
					you direct us to the coordinates.

			Chekov provides blizzard noises.

			On Enterprise, Uhura listens to the "blizzard" and checks
			her graphics display for weather report. She smiles.

							UHURA
					My visual says sunny skies and
					seventy degrees.

							CHEKOV
					Sulu! Look! The sun's come out!
					It's a miracle!

							UHURA
							(chuckling)
					Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` 
					safe with me. I'll send the
					shuttlecraft to pick you up.

								SULU
					Uhura, I owe you one. Sulu out.

			CUT TO :

		43   EXT. YOSEMITE - CAMPSITE - NIGHT

			McCoy stands over a blazing campfire. A covered pot
			simmers on the coals. McCoy rings a TRIANGLE. He's
			slightly tipsy.

								McCoy
							(calling out)
					Come and get it! Com and get it!

			CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Kirk and Spock seated two
			feet away.

								KIRK
					Knock it.. knock it... Bones...
					Bones.. knock it off. We're
					right here. And we're starving.

			McCoy grins and crouches beside the covered pot. He revels
			in their undivided attention. With a flourish, he whips
			the lid off the pot to reveal a steaming mess of beans.

							SPOCK
					Bi-podal seeds, Doctor?

								McCOY
					Beans, Spock. But no ordinary beans.
					These are from an old Southern recipe
					handed down to me by my father. And
					if you stick your Vulcan nose up at
					these, you're not only insulting me,
					but generations of McCoy's.

			McCoy ladles out the beans.

							SPOCK
					In that case, I have little choice
					but to sample your... beans.

			Kirk tears into his. Spock tries a forkful. He finds
			the taste strangely exciting.

							SPOCK
							(continuing)
					Mmmm. Surprisingly good. It does
					have a flavoring I'm not familiar
					with.

								McCoy
					Ah, that's the secret ingredient.

			Spock eats with enthusiasm.

								KIRK
					You got any more of that secret
					ingredient, Bones?

								McCOY
					Be my guest.

								KIRK
							Thank you.

			McCoy grins and pulls out a bottle of bourbon. Spock
			stops in mid-chew and McCoy fills Kirk's cup.

							SPOCK
					Am I to understand that your
					secret ingredient is.. alcohol?

								McCOY
					Whiskey. Tennessee whiskey, Spock.
					You care for a little snort?

								KIRK
					Bourbon and beans, an explosive
					combination.
							(McCoy laughs)
					Think Spock can handle it?

							McCOY
					Are you kidding? With that Vulcan
					metabolism, he could eat a bowl of
					termites and it wouldn't bother him.

							SPOCK
					As you are so fond of pointing out,
					Doctor, I am half human.

							McCOY
					Well, it certainly doesn't show.

							SPOCK
							Thank you.

								McCOY
					How do you like that - this guy
					never changes. I insult him and
					he takes it as a compliment.
						(drinks from bottle)
					Mmmm.

								KIRK
						(drinks from up)
								Ahhh.

								McCOY
					You know, you two could drive a
					man to drink.

								KIRK
							(innocent)
					What did I do?

								McCOY
					What did you do? You really piss
					me off, Jim. Human life is far too
					precious to risk crazy stunts.
					Maybe it didn't cross that macho
					mind of yours, but you should've
					been killed when you fell off that
					mountain.

								KIRK
					It crossed my mind.

							McCOY
					And?

								KIRK
					And, even as I fell, I knew I
					wouldn't die.

								McCOY
						(nodding at Spock)
					Oh? I thought he was the only one
					who's immortal.

								KIRK
					Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I
					wouldn't die because the two of
					you were with me.

							SPOCK
					I don't understand.

								KIRK
							(darkly)
					I've always known... I'll die alone.

								McCOY
							(frowning)
					Well, I'll call Valhalla and have
					them reserve a room for you.
						(shaking his head)
					It's a mystery to me what draws us
					together. All that time in space
					- getting on each other's nerves.
					And what do we do when shore leave
					comes along?
							(laughs)
					We spend it together. Other people
					have families.

								KIRK
							(wistful)
					Other people, Bones. Not us.

			They dwell on this thought for a moment. Then, Kirk
			notices that Spock has removed a sack from his backpack.
			Spock reaches into the sack and takes out a marshmallow
			which he attaches to the end of a pointed stick.


								KIRK
					What are you doing?

							SPOCK
					I am preparing to toast a marsh
					melon.

			Marsh melon? Kirk and McCoy hide their smiles as Spock
			holds the marshmallow over the fire.

								McCOY
					Well, I'll be damned. A marsh
					melon. Where'd you learn to do
					that?

							SPOCK
					Before leaving the ship, I consulted
					the computer library to familiarize
					myself with the customs associated
					with "camping out."

			Kirk and McCoy play along, amused by Spock's dead serious
			approach to frivolity.

								McCOY
					Well, tell me, Spock. What do you
					do after we toast the marsh - er,
					marsh melons?

							SPOCK
					We consume them.

								McCOY
					I know we consume them. I mean
					after that.

							SPOCK
					Oh. I believe we are required to
					engage in a ritual known as the
					singalong.

								KIRK
					That's great. I haven't sung around
					a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa.
					What are we going to sing? What...
					Bones, what are we going to sing?

								McCOY
							(thinking)
					How about "Camptown Races?"

								KIRK
					"Pack Up Your Troubles."

							SPOCK													
					Are we leaving, Captain?

								McCOY
					It's a song title, Spock.

								KIRK
					"Moon Over Rigel Seven?"

								McCOY
							(sings)
					"Row, row, row your boat..."

								KIRK
					"Row, row, row your boat..." I
					love "Row..."
							(to Spock)
					Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row,
					Row, Row Your Boat?"

							SPOCK
					That song did not come up in my
					research, Captain.

								KIRK
					The lyrics are - are very simple.
					It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat,
					gently down the stream. Merrily,
					merrily, merrily, merrily, life is
					but a dream.." The Doctor and I will
					start it off, and then when we give
					you the signal, you jump in.
							(to McCoy)
					Doctor, if you please.

			McCoy takes a hit of booze and clears his throat.

								McCOY
					Don't say I didn't warn you.

			McCoy starts to sing. Kirk joins in. Maybe it's the
			bourbon, but the two of them sound pretty good.

							KIRK AND McCOY
							(overlapping)
					"Row, row, row your boat, gently
					down the stream... merrily,
					merrily, merrily, merrily, life
					is but a dream..."

			They signal Spock that it is his turn to jump in but the
			Vulcan merely regards them quizzically. The singalong
			grinds to a halt.

								McCOY
							(sings)
					...life...

								KIRK
					Come on, Spock. Why didn't you
					jump in?

								SPOCK
					I was trying to comprehend the
					meaning of the words.

								McCOY
						(loosing patience)
					It's a song, you green-blooded
					Vulcan. You sing it. The words
					aren't important. What's important
					is that you have a good time
					singing it.

								SPOCK
							(sincere)
					Oh. I am sorry, Doctor. Were we
					having a good time?

								McCOY
							(giving up)
					God, I liked him better before he
					died.

								KIRK
					All right, all right, let's call
					it a night, will ya?

								McCOY
							(overlapping)
					He just keeps after it.

								KIRK
					Let's go to bed and just let's
					get some sleep.

			They prepare for bed.

		44   LONG SHOT - CAMPSITE

			Under a twinkling sky the three men sit around the
			campfire. Faint night sounds. Crickets. An owl.
			Then...

								SPOCK
							(troubled)
					Captain?

								KIRK
					Spock, we're on leave. You can
					call me Jim.

								SPOCK
								Jim.

								KIRK
					Yes, Spock?

								SPOCK
					Life is not a dream.

								KIRK
							(with a sigh)
					Go to sleep, Spock.

								SPOCK
					Yes, Captain.

								KIRK
					Goodnight, Bones.

								McCOY
							(sighs)
					Goodnight, Jim.

			They all lie down.

								KIRK
					Goodnight, Spock.

								SPOCK
					Goodnight, Doctor.

								McCOY
					Goodnight, Spock!

								SPOCK
					Goodnight, Jim.

								McCOY
							(sighs)
					I don't know. I just don't know.


		45   EXT. SPACE

			A NASA Pioneer probe trumbles through space. Ancient,
			forgotten, the device is flotsam. O it's side is a
			plaque showing images of two humans and simple
			mathematical and scientific symbols. It comes PAST
			CAMERA and OUT OF SHOT. In the distance, a distortion
			appears and out of this distortion, a Klingon Bird of
			Prey materializes.

		46   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Doors separate to admit KLAA, the Bird of Prey's
			swashbuckling young Captain. He is met by VIXIS, his
			First Officer, a statuesque Klingon female. It's clear
			she adores Klaa.

							VIXIS
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Captain Klaa, we have a target
					in sight. A probe of ancient
					origin.)

								KLAA
					(n Klingon; subtitled)
					(Difficult to hit?)

							VIXIS
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Most difficult.) 

								KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Good.)

			Klaa's crew watches with excitement as their Captain
			straps himself into his command chair which has been
			equipped with an elaborate gunner's rig allowing Klaa
			to do the shooting himself.

								KLAA
					(continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)
					(All weapons to my control)

			A periscope-like device swings into position in front
			of Klaa's flashing eyes.

								KLAA
					(continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Scope!)

		47   PERISCOPE - KLAA'S POV

			The probe is a tiny travelling speck in the distance. It's
			course is erratic.

		48   EXT. SPACE

			The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey swoops
			down for the attack. Machine gun-like phasers are mounted
			on the Bird's wings. They come to life and swivel,
			BLASTING a flange off the front of the probe. A SECOND
			BLAST destroys a fin on the rear of the craft. A THIRD
			SHOT blows away the antennae. Klaa is toying with the
			target. He hesitates, then finishes the probe off.

		49   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Vixis and anther crewman stand by, admiring their
			Captain and his deadly skill. But Klaa seems dissatisfied.

								KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Shooting space garbage is no test
					of a warrior's mettle. I need a
					target that fires back.)

							VIXIS
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Captain, new data. Hostages on
					Nimbus III.)

			Klaa unstraps himself from the command chair and joins
			Vixis at a monitor screen. The fearsome face of a KLINGON
			COMMANDER fills the screen and starts barking Klingon over
			shots of Nimbus III and the Paradise outpost. It's clear
			that the Bird of Prey is being ordered to Nimbus III.
			Klaa and Vixis are charged with excitement.

							VIXIS
					(continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)
					(One of the hostages is a Klingon.)

								KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(And the others?)

							VIXIS
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(A Terran and A Romulan.)

								KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(That means the Federation will be
					sending a rescue ship of its own.)
						(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Plot course for Nimbus III. I've
					always wanted to engage a Federation
					ship.)

			CUT TO :

		50   YOSEMITE - NIGHT

			A blinding light, a ball of great intensity, sets down
			on the edge of the campsite, rounding Kirk, Spock and
			McCoy from sleep.

							McCOY
					Get that damn light out of my
					face!

			The three men rise and watch as a figure in silhouette
			emerges from the light and comes forward. It's Uhura.

							UHURA
					Mr. Scott apologizes for having
					to send the shuttlecraft. The
					transporter beam is non-operational.
					Captain, we've received important
					orders from Starlet Command.

								KIRK
					Why didn't you beep my
					communicator?

							UHURA
					ER... You forgot to take it with
					you.

			Uhura hands Kirk his communicator. It's clear he left
			it behind on purpose.

								KIRK
					Oh. I wonder why I did that?
						(to Spock and McCoy)
					Well, gentlemen, it appears shore
					leave has been cancelled. Pack out
					your trash.

		51   EXT. EL CAPITAN - NIGHT

			The bright light leaves the deserted campsite and rises
			against the mountain. It turns TOWARD CAMERA and reveals
			itself as a sleek shuttlecraft of impressive design. Aft
			thrusters fire and it shoots skyward.

		52   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE

			The ship is seen in her shining glory above Earth, framed
			against a full moon. The approaching Galileo shuttlecraft
			is dwarfed by the magnificent starship.

		53   INT. GALILEO 5 SHUTTLECRAFT

			This is the Galileo 5, capable of transporting two dozen
			personnel. At the moment its passengers are Kirk, Spock,
			McCoy and Uhura, who pilots the craft.

			Kirk gazes fondly at the Enterprise.

								KIRK
					"... all I ask is a tall ship
					and a star to steer by."

							McCOY
					Melville.

							SPOCK
					John Masefield.

							McCOY
					Are you sure about that?

							SPOCK
					I am well-versed in the classics,
					Doctor.

							McCOY
							(cantankerous)
					Then how come you don't know "Row,
					Row, Row Your Boat?"

			Spock raises an eyebrow.

		54   INT. ENTERPRISE - CONTROL BOOTH OVERLOOKING LANDING BAY

			ON VIEWSCREEN,  a graphic of the approaching shuttlecraft.
			ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Scotty.

							UHURA'S VOICE
					Ready for landing. Enterprise, you
					have control.

							SCOTTY
					We're doing just fine.

		55   CONTROL BOOTH OVERLOOKING LANDING BAY

			Bay doors open to receive Galileo. The tractor beam
			locks onto the shuttlecraft and slowly pulls her
			inside. It's a delicate maneuver. Even with wings
			retracted, the Galileo clears the doors with only a few
			feet on either side.

		56   CONTROL BOOTH OVERLOOKING LANDING BAY

			Scotty operates the controls.

		57   BAY AND STAGING AREA

			The shuttlecraft comes in for a smooth landing. Its
			side hatch opens to allow Kirk and company to exit.
			There's no one to greet them, just a few crewmen
			scurrying around. Scotty appears. He may be exhausted
			and covered with grime but he's in his element.

								SULU
					What happened?

							SCOTTY
					All I can say is that they don't make
					them like they used to.

								KIRK
					You told me you could have the
					ship operational  in two weeks. I
					gave you three. What Happened?

							SCOTTY
					I think you gave me too much time,
					Captain.

								KIRK
						(hiding a smile)
					Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.

							SCOTTY
							Aye, Captain
					(shouting to some unfortunate crewman)
					How many times do I have to tell
					you? The right tool for the right 
					job...

			CAMERA FOLLOWS Kirk into the turbolift where Spock, McCoy
			and Uhura await.

							McCOY
						(indicating Scotty)
					I don't think I've seen him
					happier.

							ELEVATOR VOICE
						(badly slurred)
					Level.. level.. level..?

								KIRK
					Bridge. I hope.

			Turbolift doors close with a GRINDING SOUND. Kirk,
			Spock, McCoy and Uhura are carried upward.

								KIRK
						(to Spock, casually)
					I could use a shower.

							SPOCK
					Yes.

			A surprised reaction from Spock.

			CUT TO :

		58   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Computers come to life. Screens activate.

		59   ANGLE - TURBOLIFT

			A WHOOSH but only half the automatic door slides open.
			The other half is stuck. Kirk must manually force it
			open to enter the bridge.

								KIRK
					Doesn't anything work on this 
					ship?

							McCOY
					Starfleet's got some nerve sending
					us out in this condition with this
					handful of people.

						FEMALE YEOMAN'S VOICE
					Captain on the bridge.

			An ATTRACTIVE YEOMAN comes forward with the jacket of
			Kirk's uniform. He shrugs off his camping jacket as
			Uhura and Spock go to their stations. McCoy shakes his
			head at the noisy, messy bridge.

							UHURA
					Captain, Starfleet transmission
					on line.

								KIRK
					Put it on the veiwscreen, would
					You please?

			Kirk looks at a wall console which begins shorting out.
			A crewman lies beneath it as sparks begin to fly. The
			crewman hits his head on the wall console; more sparks.

			Kirk takes his captain's uniform jacket from the Yeoman.

								KIRK
					Can we have a little quiet,
					please?

			He puts on his Captain's jacket. The CAMERA PANS to
			reveal the veiwscreen. Kirk points, indicating the
			static on the screen.

								KIRK
					Can you...?

						COMMANDER'S VOICE
					Am I on?

								KIRK
					Can you clear that up?

			The Yeoman and a crewman stand near a toolkit which topples
			over. Kirk is beginning to get aggravated.

						COMMANDER'S VOICE
					Hello?

		60   INTERCUT WITH BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN

			Kirk is still fiddling with his buttons as the face of
			THE STARFLEET COMMANDER appears. Behind the Commander,
			images and data. The image is shaky at first.

								KIRK
					Can we have it quiet?

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
					Enterprise, this is Starfleet
					Operations. Come in.

								KIRK
					Bob?

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
						(peers uncertainly)
					Jim...? Well, we're dressing
					informally, aren't we?

			Kirk tucks in his shirt as he looks up at the veiwscreen.
			His T-shirt reds: "Go Climb a Rock."  

								KIRK
					You caught me on my way to the
					shower.

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
					I apologize for canceling shore
					leave, but look, we have a dangerous
					situation out on Nimbus III.

								KIRK
							(sarcastic)
					On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
					The same. From what we can make
					out, a terrorist force has captured
					the only settlement. And they've
					taken hostages.

			McCoy and Spock look at the O.S. action on the VIEWSCREEN.

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
							(continuing)
					The Klingon, the Romulan, the
					Federation consuls. Now I know
					Enterprise is not exactly up to
					specs...

								KIRK
					With all due respect, the Enterprise
					is a disaster. There must be other 
					ships in the quadrant.

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
					Other ships, yes. But no experienced
					commanders. Captain, I need Jim
					Kirk.

								KIRK
							(wry smile)
					Oh, please.

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
					Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus
					III, assess the situation and avoid
					a confrontation if possible. Above
					all, however, get those hostages
					back safely.

								KIRK
					Have the Klingons responded?

						COMMANDERS IMAGE
					No, but you can bet they will.

								KIRK
					Understood. Kirk out.

			Kirk addresses his expectant crew.

								KIRK
							(continuing)
					I'm afraid the ship's problems will
					have to be solved en route. Since
					we're undermanned, I'm counting on
					each one of you to give his best.
					End of speech. Let's go to work.

			McCoy slides over to Kirk.

							McCOY
					Jim if you ask me, and you haven't,
					I think this is a terrible idea.
					We're bound to run into the
					Klingons and they don't exactly
					like you.

								KIRK
					The feeling's mutual.

					Don't you worry, Captain. We'll
					beat those Klingon devils even
					if I have to get out and push.

		62   BACK TO BRIDGE

							KIRK
					I hope it won't come to that,

			Kirk turns off the comm, picks up his camping gear and
			sits in the Captain's chair.

							KIRK
							(continuing)
					All possible speed, Mr. Sulu.

							SULU
					Aye-aye, sir.

			Kirk settles into his command chair. He shifts uncomfortably.

							McCOY
					What's the matter, Jim?

							KIRK
					I miss my old chair.

		63   ANGLE ON SPOCK

			He contemplates their situation with concern.

		64   ANOTHER PART OF THE GALAXY

			The Bird of Prey slices through the fabric of space
			headed for Nimbus III.

		65   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Klaa paces his deck like a restless buccaneer, eager for

			This fact isn't lost on Klaa.

							KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Maximum speed!)

			The crew hops to it. Klaa turns to Vixis and gives her
			the chest-thumping Klingon salute.

							KLAA

							COMPUTER VOICE
					Good morning, Captain

							KIRK
					That's it. Forget it.

			The Yeoman takes the malfunctioning Captain's Log and

							KIRK
						Put it on the screen.

			CAMERA PANS to reveal veiwscreen b.g. Kirk joins Sulu

			Spock and McCoy come forward to watch.

		68   INTERCUT WITH BRIDGE VEIWSCREEN

			The screen comes to life and fizzles out. Then pops
			back on. Factual information, photographs, film and
			visual illustrations depict the backgrounds of the
			three hostages.

							KIRK
						Not General Korrd.

							SPOCK
					The same. He's apparently fallen
					out of favor with the Klingon High
					Command.

							KIRK
							(fondly)
					General Korrd's military strategies
					were required learning when I was
					a cadet at the Academy. When they
					put me out to pasture, I hope I
					fare better than Korrd.

							McCOY
					Oh, this must be the hostage tape.

			A tape of poor quality. Images and SOUND come and go.
			A static shot of Caithlin Dar, flanked by Talbot and
			Korrd. Unlike the lively girl of the first scene.
			Caithlin is now restrained, dazed. Talbot and Korrd
			are also strangely subdued. In the b.g. we can see
			several of Sybok's soldiers brandishing weapons.
 
						CAITHLIN'S IMAGE
					A short time ago, we willingly
					surrendered ourselves to the forces
					of the Galactic Army of Light. At
					this moment we're in their protective
					custody. Their leader assures us
					that we will be treated humanely
					so long as you cooperate with his
					demands. I believe his sincerity.
					He requests that you send a
					Federation starship to parlay for
					our release at once. Be assured
					that we are in good health, and
					would appreciate your immediate
					response.

						SYBOK'S IMAGE
					I deeply regret this desperate act,
					but these are desperate times. I
					have no desire to harm these
					innocents but do not put me to the
					test. I implore you to respond
					immediately.

			End of transmission. Spock strides to Uhura's console.

			He backwinds the tape and FREEZE FRAMES on Sybok's face.
			It's blurry, indistinct. Spock is transfixed by the

			A vast area designed for contemplation. The most
			arresting feature is an antique ship's wheel - the
			kind Horatio Hornblower might have steered. The wheel
			stands in front of tall curving windows that offer an
			impressive space vista.

			Spock is beside the wheel staring at the stars, lost in
			thought. Kirk and McCoy enter with urgency and approach
			Spock, interrupting is reverie. Throughout the following, 
			Spock continues to stare thoughtfully at the stars.

							KIRK
					Spock, what is it? Do you know
					this Vulcan?

							SPOCK
					I cannot be certain.

							KIRK
					But he does seem familiar?

							SPOCK
					He reminds me of someone I knew
					in my youth.

							McCoy
					Why, Spock, I didn't know you had
					one.

							SPOCK
					I do not often think of the past.

							KIRK
							(gently)
					Who is it he reminds you of?

							SPOCK
					There was a young student,
					exceptionally gifted, possessing
					of great intelligence. It was 
					assumed that one day he would take
					his place amongst the great
					scholars of Vulcan. But he was a 
					revolutionary.

							KIRK
						What do you mean?

							SPOCK
					The knowledge and experience he
					sought were forbidden by Vulcan
					belief.

							McCOY
							Forbidden?

							SPOCK
					He rejected his logical upbringing
					and embraced the animal passions
					of our ancestors.

							KIRK
							Why?

							SPOCK
					He believed the key to self-knowledge
					was emotion, not logic.

							McCOY
					Imagine that. A passionate Vulcan.

							SPOCK
					When he encouraged others to follow
					him, he was banished from Vulcan,
					never to return.

							KIRK
						(studying Spock)
					Fascinating.

						UHURA'S VOICE
					Captain to the bridge.

							KIRK
					On my way.

			Kirk and McCoy head for the exit. Kirk hesitates on
			the threshold. He looks back into the room. Spock is

			As the soldiers continue to climb the dune toward
			Uhura, two Enterprise crewmen enter and point their
			phasers at them. Other crewmen lie in the sand flanking
			Uhura's dancing feet. The Soldiers, taken by surprise,
			stop mid-climb.

							UHURA
					Hello, boys... I've always wanted
					to play to a captive audience.

							SOLDIER
					Oh, damn.

		89   EXT. DUNES - NIGHT

			Snarling horses pound over a rise, sending sand in all
			directions. Riders hurtle PAST CAMERA with flowing
			capes and cowled faces. Ahead of them, Paradise City.
			Behind them, the desert - a sea of darkness.

		90   ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK

			Kirk rides with determination, his face nearly hidden
			behind a burnoose. He looks over at the rider beside
			him. It's Spock, bouncing stiffly in the saddle, doing
			all he can to hang on.

							KIRK
					Spock.

							SPOCK
					Yes, Captain?

							KIRK
						(can't resist)
					Be one with the horse.

							SPOCK
					Yes, Captain.

		91   EXT. PARADISE CITY GATE

			Armed sentries watch from the walls as the scruffy band
			of horsemen crosses the desert. J'onn, Sybok's first
			convert, appears looking concerned.

							J'ONN
					Open the gate. It's our lookout
					party.

			The huge iron gate swings open.

		92   ANGLE - THE HORSEMEN

			They gallop at full tilt, led by Kirk. He shouts
			frantically to the sentries.

							KIRK
					Federation soldiers right behind
					us. Close the gate!

			As Kirk and his party gallop through, the gate is closed
			behind them.

		93   INT. PARADISE - MAIN STREET

			Kirk and company proceed up the street, coaxing their
			horses toward the saloon at its end.

							J'ONN
							(to men)
					Where are they going?

			They ride slowly, not wanting to attract more any more
			attention than they have.

			Occasionally a crew member drops away from the group
			and dismounts, taking a position where he can lay down
			cover for the eventual escape.

		94   ANGLE - THE HORSEMEN

			Kirk's eyes sweep around. There are soldiers on most
			of the rooftops, heavily armed and dangerous-looking.

							KIRK
						(urgent whisper)
					Spock.

			Spock hides a tricorder in his lap.

							SPOCK
					Hold your horse, Captain. I'm
					scanning.
						(indicating the saloon)
					The hostages are in the structure
					just ahead.

			Hiding it from view, Kirk raises a communicator to his
			lips.

							KIRK
					This is Strike Team. Start your
					run.

		95   GATE

			While the others watch the desert, J'onn turns to watch
			the horsemen.

							J'ONN
							(suspicious)
					Who are you?

			J'onn rushes to the big spotlight anchored on the wall.
			He swings its bright beam in the direction of the
			horsemen.

		96   STREET

			Sulu and Kirk are revealed as the light sweeps across
			them. Kirk and the others turn and react to the light,
			realizing the jig is up.

							KIRK
							(shouting)
					Phasers on stun! Get rid of the
					mounts! Sulu - take out that
					light!

							SULU
					Yes, Captain.

			The crewmen dismount and whip out the phaser rifles
			they've hidden under their robes.

		97   ANGLE - SULU

			Sulu spears his horse and charges at the spotlight as
			pebbles fired from the enemy's crude weapons whiz around
			him like hungry hornets. He gallops toward the blinding
			light. A BAZOOKA SHELL EXPLODES near him and he is
			knocked from his mount, but manages to roll away toward
			the spotlight and rises up to his knees. He raises his
			phaser and with an expert shot, blows the spotlight to
			bits as J'onn holds it. The street goes dark, lit now
			by neon and the flash of gunfire and phasers.

		98   INT. SALOON

			Sybok reacts to the gunfire.

							SYBOK
					What's going on?

						CHEKOV'S IMAGE
					I instruct you to surrender. You
					are under attack by Federation forces.

							SYBOK
							(angered)
					Do you realize what you've done?
					It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.

			Sybok turns and strides out of the room, his robes
			swirling around him.

						CHEKOV'S IMAGE
					Wait! Come back!

		99   EXT. STREETS OF PARADISE - A SERIES OF SHOTS

			A symphony of smoke and gunfire. Dizzying action.
			Running figures. Stampeding horses.

			ANGLE - KIRK

			Kirk dismounts; his horse runs off. A soldier rushes
			in and thrusts his weapon at Kirk, who grabs it and
			strikes the man in the face. He knocks him O.S. and
			takes the weapon.

		101  LOW ANGLE

			The soldiers on the walls and rooftops open fire with
			their crude weapons. The Enterprise crewmen fight back
			from strategic positions along the street, expertly
			picking off the enemy and using their transparent shields
			to repel the volley of pebbles.

	102   A BLINDING EXPLOSION

	103   ANGLE - KIRK

			A soldier grabs Kirk; they struggle. Kirk flips him
			OUT OF SHOT. Another soldier hurries in shooting as
			he climbs over a wall. Other crewmen hit still more
			soldiers with phaser fire. They scream and fall.

	104   ANGLE - SPOCK

			The Vulcan dismounts. As he heads for the saloon AN
			ENEMY SOLDIER leaps from a balcony, landing squarely in
			the saddle of Spock's horse. Armed with a sword the
			Soldier urges the steed forward to trample Spock. As Spock
			turns in response, the Soldier rears the horse up on its
			hind legs. Hooves threaten to pummel Spock to a hamburger.

			Spock calmly reaches up and presses his fingers into the
			horse's neck, executing a Vulcan nerve pinch. The horse
			and its rider tumble to the ground as Spock walks off.

	105   ANGLE - KIRK

			He stands in the doorway, back-lit by an inner bright light.


							KIRK
					Uhura, come on down.

	106   INT. SHUTTLECRAFT

			Uhura is at the controls.

							UHURA
					Roger. Coming in.

	107   EXT. ROOFTOP

			Sybok's soldiers set up a multiple pipe weapon cranked
			like a Gattling gun. Like the other weapons, it uses
			pebbles for bullets. One of them catches an Enterprise
			crewman in the leg. He goes down.

	108   ANGLE - KIRK

			Kirk shoots his phaser toward the lights of the building
			housing the saloon. The lights EXPLODE.

	109   INT. SALOON

			Dark and empty. Phaser drawn, Kirk cautiously makes his
			way across the room when, with a sudden hiss, the Dancing
			Catwoman leaps over the bar and pounces on his back. As
			she claws at him, Kirk twirls her around in an "airplane
			spin" and throws her the length of the room. The
			Catwoman lands in the "pool" table, sending up a wave
			of water that soaks the walls.

	110   ANGLE

			Spock enters and reacts to the unconscious floating
			Catwoman as Kirk blasts open the door to the back room.

					TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
					... recreational opportunities
					are limitless.. The vicinity is
					famous for plentiful local
					wildlife. And the fishing is
					terrific...

			Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot look up in surprise. Kirk
			breathes a sigh of relief.

	111   ANGLE - SPOCK

			Spock appears at Kirk's side.

					TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
					(continuing; overlapping)
					... easy financing through Federation
					Federal can put you in your own home
					on the beautiful, conveniently
					located...

							KIRK
							(to Spock)
					Thank God...

	112   ANGLE - THE HOSTAGES

			Kirk signals for the hostages to follow them. But the
			hostages confound them by pointing three crude pistols
			at their heads.

							CAITHLIN
					Please cooperate.

							KORRD
					Ahhh...

							TALBOT
							(quite sober)
					Would you mind handing over your
					weapons?

					TELEVISION ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
							(continuing)
					Beam on down!
							(laughs)

	113   EXT. PARADISE - STREET

			Kirk and Spock are marched out off the saloon by the
			hostages. The rest of the Enterprise crew is herded
			together to the accompaniment of thunderous cheers from
			Sybok's soldiers.

							SYBOK
						(smiling at J'onn; 
						over their cheers)
					Well done, my friends.

			An armed soldier pushes Uhura toward a smiling Sybok and
			J'onn.

	114   ANGLE - SPOCK

			As the cheers begin to die, Spock detaches himself from
			Kirk and McCoy. Sybok notices him. For the first time
			we see him vulnerable.

							SYBOK
					Spock. It's me. It's Sybok.
					After all these years, you've
					finally caught up with me.
					Don't you have anything to say
					to me?

			It's clear Sybok is trying to force an emotional reaction
			from Spock. But Spock refuses to fall into his trap.

							SPOCK
					You are under arrest for seventeen
					violations of the Neutral Zone
					Treaty.

			Sybok is incredulous. There must be a hundred guns pointed
			at Spock's heart. Sybok can't help it. He chuckles.
			The chuckle becomes a full rich laugh. The soldiers join
			in and soon their laughter is ringing through Paradise.

							SYBOK
					Spock, you've developed a sense 
					of humor after all.

							SPOCK
					It was not my intention to amuse
					you. These are serious charges.
					However, if you surrender now-

							SYBOK
					I'm sorry, Spock. I can't
					surrender now. I'm not through
					violating Neutral Zone Treaty.
					In fact, I'm just getting started.
					And now for my next violation I intend
					to steal something. Something
					very big.

			J'onn and several soldiers laugh and cheer.

							SYBOK
							(continuing)
					I must have your starship.

							KIRK
					(stepping forward as 
							he realizes)
					You staged all this to get your
					hands on my ship?

			Sybok regards Kirk in his grubby commando outfit.

							SYBOK
					Who are you?

							KIRK
					James T. Kirk, Captain of the 
					Enterprise.

							SYBOK
					But I thought Captain Chekov..
							(realizing)
					I see. Very clever, Captain.
					(turning t Spock with excitement)
					Spock, it would appear that you've
					been given a second chance to join
					me. What do you say?

							SPOCK
					I am a Starfleet Officer.

							SYBOK
					Of course. Of course. Then I'll
					take the ship without your help.

			The soldiers cheer wildly, waving their weapons in the
			air.

			CUT TO :

	115   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE

			Waiting. Vulnerable.

	116   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Chekov, Scotty and a tense crew.

							SCOTTY
					Shuttle en route.

							CHEKOV
					Position, Bird of Prey?

							SCOTTY

					Closing.

	117   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - BIRD OF PREY

			The Klingon ship approaches Nimbus III.

	118   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Klaa and Vixis react to Enterprise on their veiwscreen.

							VIXIS
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Estimating attack range in 8,000
					Kellicams.)

			Klaa casually slips into the gunner's rig.

	119   EXT.`SPACE - ANGLE - BIRD OF PREY

			The ship distorts and becomes invisible.

	120   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Scotty reacts to monitor screen

							SCOTTY
					Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of
					Prey. She must have cloaked.

							CHEKOV
					Raise shields.

							SCOTTY
					But the shuttle-

							CHEKOV
							(in charge)
					DO it. Go to Red Alert.

			Scotty punches in commands. On his graphics screen a
			series of dots winks on around an outline of the ship.

	121   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - GALILEO

			Slowly heading back to the ship. Enterprise is in the
			far distance.

	122   INT. GALILEO

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy are guarded by J'onn and a select
			handful of Sybok's soldiers. Sulu and Uhura pilot the
			craft while Sybok confers with Caithlin and Korrd.
			The remainder of the Enterprise crew has been left
			behind on Nimbus III.

							TALBOT
					Once we've taken control of your
					vessel, we'll bring up the rest
					of our followers.

							KIRK
							(scoffing)
					The Klingons are out there.
							(continuing)
					We'll be lucky to get back to the

			They are interrupted by Chekov's voice on the radio.

							CHEKOV'S VOICE
					Galileo, this is Enterprise.
					Condition Red Alert. Bird of Prey
					approaching. She is cloaked.
					Raising shields.

	123   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FEATURING CHEKOV

							CHEKOV
					Recommend Galileo find safe harbor

	124   INT. GALILEO

							CHEKOV'S VOICE
					Acknowledge.

			Sulu and Uhura turn to Kirk for instruction.

							SYBOK
					No! No reply. Remain on course.

							KIRK
					Sybok, listen to me. In order for
					this craft to enter the landing bay,
					Enterprise must lower the shields
					and activate the tractor beam. To
					get us inside and re-raise the 
					shields will take-

							SPOCK
					Exactly 15.5 seconds.

							KIRK
					An eternity during which we'll be
					vulnerable to Klingon attack.
					Korrd-you tell him.

							KORRD
					He speaks the truth. If my people
					are cloaked, then they intend to
					strike.

							SYBOK
					We cannot turn back.

			Sybok regards Kirk with suspicion. He turns to Spock,
			the only one he can trust.

							SPOCK
					You must allow us to act.

							KIRK
					Let me do something.

							SYBOK
					Very well.
							(to Kirk)
					Do what you must-but no more.

			Kirk punches a button on the console.

							KIRK
					Enterprise.

	125   INT. BIRD OF PREY

			The Klingons have been monitoring the exchange between
			Enterprise and Galileo.

							KIRK'S VOICE
					This is Kirk.

							KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Kirk! He's on the shuttlecraft!
					Alter the attack course!)

	126   INT. GALILEO

							KIRK
					Understand your situation. Are

					Emergency Landing plan.. B

	127   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Chekov and Scotty exchange confused looks.

							CHEKOV
						(aside to Scotty)
					What's Emergency Landing Plan B?

							SCOTTY
					I don't have a clue.

							KIRK'S VOICE
					B as in "barricade."

							SCOTTY
							(alarmed)
					He can't be serious.

	128   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE AND GALILEO

			The shuttle draws closer.

	129   INT. GALILEO

			Enterprise looms through the windshield.

							SYBOK
					What are you doing?

							KIRK
					In order to lower and raise the
					shields as quickly as possible, we're
					going to forego the tractor beam and
					fly her in manually.

							McCOY
							(horrified)
					Manually?

							SYBOK
							(to Sulu)
					How often have you done this?

							SULU
					Actually it's my first attempt.

			Sybok looks at Kirk in amazement. Kirk smiles uneasily
			and indicates Sulu.

							KIRK
					He's good. Really
							(then)
					Scotty, on my mark. Open bay
					doors.

	130   EXT. ENTERPRISE -FANTAIL

			With agonizing slowness, the bay doors begin to open.

	131   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Klaa flexes his itchy trigger-finger and peers into his
			view scope.

	132   KLAA'S POV - VEIW SCOPE

					Kirk to Scotty-lower shields!

	134   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Scotty punches in commands.

							SCOTTY
					Lowering shields, sir.

			On Scotty's graphic's screen, the dots wink out around
			the outline of the ship. Enterprise is now vulnerable.

	135   EXT. SPACE

			The Bird of Prey materializes.

	136   INT. GALILEO

			The Klingon ship is sighted.

							UHURA
					Bird of Prey bearing one zero

							KIRK
					Go, Sulu.

			Sulu hits the aft thrusters and the shuttle roars to
			life.

	137   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE AND GALILEO

			The shuttlecraft takes off with a tremendous kick. Like
			it was fired from a slingshot, the tiny craft closes the
			gap between itself and the Enterprise at alarming speed. But
			the bay doors - they haven't opened wide enough yet.
			Just when it looks like the Galileo will pulp itself on the
			fantail, she banks ninety degrees.

	138   INT. ENTERPRISE - LANDING BAY

			Galileo negotiates the narrow opening by coming in on its
			side. It skids down the runway, showering sparks all the
			way, unable to stop. To our surprise, a cargo net pops
			up to keep it from crashing into the retaining wall.

	139   INT. GALILEO

			As the shuttle recoils against the net, passengers are
			thrown about like rag dolls. Lights blow out and
			instrument panels EXPLODE.

	140   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

							SCOTTY
					They're in!

	141   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Klaa gapes in surprise. The target has zoomed out of

					(Enterprise Targeted!)

	142   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Klaa looks through the view scope, turns the firing
			handles.

							KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Fire!)

	144   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE

			One moment she's there, the next she's gone in a flash
			of blinding light. Klaa's shot goes to the void.

	145   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			Klaa reacts in amazement to Enterprise's sudden
			departure.

							KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Track her course!)

			As Vixis and her crew hop to it, CAMERA PUSHES IN on Klaa
			who throws off his gunner's rig, unable to hide his
			admiration for Kirk's cleverness.

							KLAA
					(continuing; in Klingon; subtitled)
					(He's good.)

	146   INT. ENTERPRISE - LANDING BAY

			The badly-damaged Galileo lies smoldering on its side.

	147   INT. GALILEO

			In the smoking wreckage, passengers have been flung
			everywhere. No one's been killed but are all dazed
			or unconscious. Sybok and Kirk come to simultaneously.
			But before Kirk can act, Sybok snatches up a primitive
			shooting weapon and aims it at him.

							SYBOK
					We must change our course at once.

							KIRK
							(crafty)
					I'll take you to the bridge.

	148   INT. LANDING BAY

			The Galileo's back hatch blows open emitting a cloud of
			smoke along with Kirk and Sybok. As Sybok steps down
			behind him, Kirk whirls and grabs for the weapon. The
			two men struggle and tumble across the landing bay floor.

	149   ANGLE - KIRK AND SYBOK

			Kirk is no match for the Vulcan's superior strength but
			he fights with everything he's got. He manages to
			knock the weapon from Sybok's hand. It skitters across
			the floor and stops at the feet of Spock who has emerged
			from the shuttle.

			Spock looks down at the weapon, then back to Kirk whom
			Sybok is rendering helpless with one hand. With his
			incredible strength Sybok forces Kirk to the floor.

							KIRK
							(in pain)
					Spock... pick it up!

			Spock obediently picks up the weapon like it was a
			distasteful object. Kirk collapses on the floor, conscious
			but no longer able to fight. Spock faces Sybok.

							SPOCK
					Sybok, you must surrender.

							SYBOK
					No. You must kill me.

			Sybok advances toward Spock until the weapon is pressing
			into Sybok's chest.

							KIRK
							(desperate)
					Shoot him!

			But Spock can't shoot. The emotional price is too great.
			He lowers the weapon in shame and defeat. Sybok takes
			it from him with a smile.

							SYBOK
					For a moment, I thought you might
					actually do it.

	150   ANGLE

			Sybok's soldiers emerge from the wreckage of the shuttle
			with McCoy. The doctor hurries to Kirk and helps him to
			his feet. Kirk, in pain and betrayed, glares at Spock
			who cannot meet his eyes.

			Sybok turns to J'onn. He indicates Kirk and McCoy.

							SYBOK
					Put him in the brig with Captain
					Kirk.
						(then, to Spock)
					Spock, you will accompany me to
					the bridge?

							SPOCK
						(finding his voice)
					No. I will not.

							SYBOK
					You know I'm right.

			He is met by stony silence.

							SYBOK
					(continuing; a long pause)
					Then you must join them.

			J'onn and several other soldiers march Kirk, Spock and
			McCoy out.

	151   ANGLE - LANDING BAY

			Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot emerge from the shuttle with
			Sulu and Uhura in tow.

							KORRD
					These two will be useful.

			Uhura and Sulu are defiant. Sybok approaches them.

							SYBOK
					Give us a moment alone.

							CAITHLIN
						(to Uhura and Sulu)
					Don't be afraid.

	152   ANGLE - LANDING BAY CONTROL BUBBLE

			Scotty witnesses the action on the deck below.
			Fortunately, no one sees him. He steps back into the
			shadows.

			CUT TO :

	153   BRIG

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy are shoved into a cell by J'onn.
			Phaser beam bars materialize to contain them. Kirk is
			enraged.

							KIRK
					Damnit, Spock. God damnit!

							SPOCK
					Captain, what have I done - 

							KIRK
					What you have done is betray
					every man on this ship.

							SPOCK
					Worse. I have betrayed you. I
					do not expect you to forgive me.

							KIRK
					Forgive you? I ought to knock you
					on your goddamn ass!

							SPOCK
					If you think it would help.

							McCOY
					You want me to hold him, Jim?

							KIRK
					You stay out of this!
							(to Spock)
					Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you
					had to do was pull the trigger.

							SPOCK
					If I had pulled the trigger, 
					Sybok would be dead.

							KIRK
					I ordered you to defend this ship.

							SPOCK
					You ordered me to kill my brother.

							KIRK
					Look, the man may be a fellow
					Vulcan, but that doesn't...

							SPOCK
					No, no, no, Captain. You do not
					understand. Sybok also in a son
					of Sarek.

			Kirk and McCoy can't believe it.

							KIRK
					You mean he's your brother brother?
							(flustered)
					You made that up!

							SPOCK
					I did not.

							KIRK
					You did too. Sybok couldn't
					possibly be your brother because
					I happen to know for a fact that
					you don't have a brother.

							SPOCK
					Technically, you are correct. I
					do not have a brother.

							KIRK
					There, you see? See?

							SPOCK
					I have a half brother.

							KIRK
						(suddenly weary)
					I gotta sit down.

							McCOY
					Let me get this straight. You and
					Sybok have the same father but
					different mothers.

							SPOCK
					Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's
					mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon
					her death, Sybok and I were raised
					as brothers.

							KIRK
					Why didn't you tell me this before?

							SPOCK
					I was not disposed to discuss...
					matters of a personal nature. For
					that, I'm sorry.

							KIRK
						(still fuming)
					He's sorry, See, he's sorry.
					Everything... that makes everything
					all right. He's sorry, everything's...

							McCOY
					Stop it, Jim. Spock could no more
					kill his own brother than he could
					kill you. If you want to punish
					him for what he's done, why don't
					you throw him in the brig?

			Kirk's anger burns itself out.

							McCOY
							(continuing)
					Besides, we've got bigger problems
					to deal with. Like how the hell
					to get out of here.
						(a beat; turning to Spock)
					I'll say one thing, Spock. You
			never cease to amaze me.

							SPOCK
					Nor I myself.

			CUT TO :

							CHEKOV
					I was beginning to worry. Where

			Sybok enters, followed by the hostages and several armed
			soldiers. Chekov looks at Uhura and Sulu in confusion.
			They, like the hostages, are smiling warmly - converts
			to Sybok's cause.

							UHURA
					It's all right Pavel. Sybok
					will explain everything.

			Sulu moves past Chekov and takes his seat at the helm.
			He punches in commands.

							CHEKOV
					Sulu, what are you doing?

							SULU
					Plotting our new course.

							CHEKOV
							(alarmed)
					New course? You have no authority.
							(to Sybok)
					What's going on here?

							SULU
					Pavel.

							SYBOK
					I won't force you.

							SULU
							(overlapping)
					You've got to listen to this man.

							SYBOK
							(overlapping)
					The decision must be yours.

							CHEKOV
					I don't understand.

					Each of us hides a secret pain.
					Share yours with me and gain

	155   INT. BRIG

			Kirk balances on Spock's shoulders, examining the

							SPOCK
					Useless.

			Kirk stands on Spock's shoulders, now holding on to a
			pipe.

							SPOCK
							(continuing)
					Unwise.

			Kirk investigates a circuitry panel. He touches it and
			receives a shock that causes him to tumble to the floor.

							KIRK
						(irked at Spock)
					You could've warned me.

							McCOY
					He did, Jim.

							KIRK
					There's got to be a way out of

							SPOCK
					This is a new brig, Captain. It
					is escape-proof.

							KIRK
					How do you know?

							SPOCK
					The designers tested it using the
					most intelligent and resourceful
					person they could find. He failed
					to escape.

							KIRK
					(as he and McCoy realize)
					This, er, person... didn't by any

							SPOCK
					He did have pointed ears.

	157   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Uhura and Sulu are at their stations. Chekov once
			again occupies the command chair. Sybok stands
			beside him. In the background are Caithlin, Korrd
			and Talbot.

							CHEKOV
						(pleased to report)
					Following new course. Warp
					seven.

							SULU
					Estimating destination in 6.7
					hours, present speed.

			Sybok looks happy and paternal, less driven. He turns
			to Uhura.

							SYBOK
					Now that we're underway, it's
					time I announced my intentions to
					the rest of the ship.
							(then, to comm)
					Brave crew of the Starship
					Enterprise... Consider the questions
					of existence. These are the
					questions which man has asked ever
					since he first gazed at the stars
					and dreamed.

	158   INT. BRIG

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy discontinue their efforts to
			escape and now peer instead at a monitor screen beyond
			the cell

	159   INTERCUTTING WITH MONITOR SCREEN

							SYBOK'S IMAGE
							(continuing)
					My Vulcan ancestors were ruled by
					their emotions. They felt with
					their hearts. They believed with
					their hearts. But above all else,
					they believed in a place in which
					these questions of existence would
					be answered. Modern dogma tells us
					this place is a myth, a fantasy
					concocted by pagans.

	160   INT. LANDING BAY

			A crewman pauses to listen to Sybok's continuing speech.

							SYBOK'S VOICE
							(emphatic)
					It is no fantasy! I tell you it
					exists!

	161   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			CAMERA PANS the bridge to find crew and soldiers focused
			on Sybok's words.

							SYBOK
						(continuing; with
						great excitement)
					My brothers, we have been chosen
					to undertake the greatest adventure
					of all time - the discovery of
					Sha Ka Ree.

	162   INT. BRIG

			Baffled responses from Kirk and McCoy.

							SPOCK
							(intrigued)
					Is it possible?

							KIRK
					Is what possible?

							SPOCK
					That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree.
					The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

	163   INT. BRIDGE

							SYBOK
					Our destination is the planet
					Sha Ka Ree, which lies beyond the
					Great Barrier...

	164   INT. BRIG

			Spock turns back to Sybok's image.

							SYBOK'S IMAGE
							(continuing)
					... at the center of the galaxy.

							KIRK
							(alarmed)
					The center of the galaxy?

							SPOCK
					There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to
					exist.

							KIRK
					But the center of the galaxy can't
					be reached. No ship has ever gone
					into the Great Barrier. No probe
					has ever returned.

							SPOCK
					Sybok possessed the keenest
					intellect I have ever known.

							KIRK
					Spock! My only concern is getting
					the ship back. When that's done
					and Sybok is in here then you can
					debate Sha Ka Ree until you're
					green in the face. Until then,
					you're either with me or you're
					not.

							SPOCK
						(as if it's obvious)
					I am here, Captain.

							KIRK
					That's a little vague, Spock - 

			An infrequent, almost inaudible tapping SOUND comes from
			the back wall of the cell.

							KIRK
							(continuing;
							distracted)
					What's that noise?

			They turn and regard the back wall. The tapping continues.

							SPOCK
					I believe it is a primitive form
					of communication known as Morse
					Code.

			They scramble over and huddle beside the wall.

							KIRK
					You're right. I'm a little out
					of practice.
							(listening)
					Uh....that's an "s."

							SPOCK
					A "t."

							KIRK
					"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.

							McCOY
					"Stand."

							KIRK
					New word. "b".. "a"... um...

							SPOCK
					"c."... "k."

							McCOY
					"Back." "Stand back."

			They're about to congratulate themselves when they realize
			it's a warning.

							TOGETHER
							(in horror)
					Stand back!!

			They dive for cover as a large panel EXPLODES from the
			wall, showering them with dust. Scotty appears in the
			opening.

							SCOTTY
							
					What are you standing around
					for? Do you not know a jailbreak
					when you see one?

			CUT TO :

	165   INT. CORRIDOR

			Sybok, J'onn and Sulu exit the turbolift and head for
			the brig.

							SYBOK
					The bond between these three is
					strong... difficult to penetrate.
					This will be quite a challenge.

			The brig doors WHOOSH open. They step inside and are
			confronted with an empty cell. The prisoners have
			vanished.

							SULU
			We've got to find them!

			CUT TO :

	166   INT. BOWELS OF ENTERPRISE

			Scotty leads Kirk, Spock and McCoy through the labyrinth
			innards of the ship.

							SCOTTY
					Captain, we can't trust anyone
					now.

							KIRK
					If we could send a distress
					signal...

							SPOCK
					There is an emergency sending
					apparatus in the forward observation
					room.

							KIRK
					The only problem is, it's up there.
					We're down here.

							SCOTTY
					You might be able to reach it by
					means of turbo shaft number three
					which is closed for repairs. It's
					a long and dangerous climb.

							McCOY
					Some of us get off on long and
					dangerous climbs.

							KIRK
					Mr. Scott, get the transporter
					working. If we contact a rescue
					ship we'll need it.
							(then)
					Which way to the turbo shaft?

							SCOTTY
					Head down that tunnel to the hydro
					vent and turn right. Then left
					at the blowscreen. You can't miss
					it.

							KIRK
					Mr. Scott, you're amazing.

		Scotty walks off in the opposite direction.

							SCOTTY
						(a little too prideful)
					Oh, there's nothing amazing about
					it. I know this ship like the back
					of my hand.

			Scotty turns the corner and whacks his head on a low-
			hanging pipe. He collapses to the floor, out cold.

			CUT TO :

	167   INT. CORRIDOR

			A warning KLAXON SOUNDS. Sybok's soldiers sweep through
			the ship.

	168   INT. TURBO SHAFT

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy gaze up at a narrow and seemingly
			endless elevator shaft. An emergency ladder attached
			to the wall is the only way up.

							KIRK
					All right, look at it this way.
					We'll get a good workout.

							McCOY
					Yeah. Or a heart attack.

			Kirk starts to climb the emergency ladder. McCoy
			reluctantly follows. Spock watches. Then, unnoticed,
			he slips away.

	169   INT. BOWELS OF ENTERPRISE

			Sulu, leading a team of converts, rounds a corner and
			nearly stumbles over Scotty. Scotty groans.

							SULU
						(to a crewman)
			Get Mr. Scott to sick bay.

	170   INT. TURBO SHAFT - MIDWAY - MINUTES LATER

			Kirk climbs hand over hand, followed by a huffing and
			puffing McCoy.

							McCOY
							(breathless)
					Jim, this is going to take me
					forever.

							KIRK
						(suddenly realizing)
					Where's Spock?

			Kirk and McCoy look down. No Spock. Just then, a soft
			WHOOSHING SOUND from above. They look up.

	171   ANGLE

			Spock descends wearing the levitation boots from Yosemite.
			He floats alongside Kirk and McCoy, hovering in midair.

							SPOCK
					I believe I have found a faster
					way.

							KIRK
					Hmmm?

							SPOCK
					Uh-uh.

			Kirk breaks into a smile of relief. He steps off the
			ladder and grabs onto Spock. They dip down a few feet,
			then slowly rise to a hovering position beside McCoy.

							KIRK
					Bones...?

							McCOY
							(wary)
					You two go ahead. I'll wait for the
					next car.

							KIRK
					We're not splitting up.

			Grumbling, a little fearful, McCoy steps on board. Their
			combined weight causes them to sink steadily downward.

							SPOCK
					It would appear we are too heavy.

							KIRK
					It must be all those marsh melons.

	172   ANGLE - BELOW

			Sulu and the search party appear at the bottom of the
			shaft, armed with phasers.

	173   ANGLE - KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

			Sinking lower, on the verge of capture.

							KIRK
					Spock... the booster rockets.

							SPOCK
					If I activate them now, Captain,
					we will be propelled upward at an
					unbelievable rate.

							KIRK
							(an order)
					Fire the rockets!

			Spock hits the boosters. With an explosion of power and
			NOISE they shoot skyward like a bullet.

	174   ANGLE - BELOW

			Rocket smoke shoots downward enveloping Sulu and the 
			search party.

							SULU
					Captain, please come back down 
					here.

	175   ANGLE - KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

			Our hero's are an upward blur that shows no sign of
			stopping.

							KIRK
							(shouts)
					Hit the brakes!

			Spock hits "the brakes" and they stop barely one floor
			from the ceiling, bobbing in midair. Kirk and McCoy are
			white as sheets.

							SPOCK
					I'm afraid I overshot the mark
					by one level.

							McCOY
						(scared shitless)
					Nobody's perfect.

	176    INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

			Dark, deserted. The grandeur of space lies beyond the
			tall curving windows.

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy enter and cross to the
			communications console. Spock activates it. Functions
			come to life.

							KIRK
					Spock.

							SPOCK
					The emergency channel, open.

							KIRK
					To anyone within the sound of my
					voice: This is Captain James T.
					Kirk of the Federation Starship
					Enterprise. If you read me,
					acknowledge. Acknowledge.

							FEMALE VOICE
					Enterprise, this is Starfleet
					Command. We read you. Over.

							KIRK
						(encouraged)
					A hostile force has seized control
					of our vessel and put us on a 
					direct course with the Great
					Barrier. Our coordinates are
					zero-zero-zero...

							SPOCK
					...mark two.

							KIRK
							(continuing)
					Mark two. Request emergency
					assistance. Acknowledge.

	177   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			To reveal the "Starfleet Command" voice belongs to
			Vixis. Behind her Klaa sits, smugly confident.

							VIXIS
					(in English)
					Understood, Enterprise. We are
					dispatching a rescue ship
					immediately.

							KIRK'S VOICE
					Roger, Starfleet.

							KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Plot course zero-zero-zero, mark
					two.)

							VIXIS
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(But Captain, that course will take
					us into the Barrier as well.)

			Klaa isn't about to let a small thing like death stop
			him.

							KLAA
					(in Klingon; subtitled)
					(Where Kirk goes, we follow.)

	178   INT. ENTERPRISE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy start for the exit when they are
			startled by the appearance of Sybok, J'onn and several
			armed soldiers.

							SYBOK
					I trust your message was received?

							KIRK
					You can't expect us to stand by
					while you take the ship into the
					Great Barrier.

							SYBOK
					What you fear is the unknown. The
					people of your planet once believed
					their world was flat. Columbus
					proved it was round. They said
					the sound barrier could never be
					broken. It was broken. They said
					warp speed could not be achieved.
					The Great Barrier is the ultimate
					expression of this universal fear.
					It's an extension of personal fear.
							(a beat)
					Captain Kirk, I so much want your
					understanding. I want your
					respect. Are you afraid to hear
					me out?

							KIRK
					I'm afraid of nothing.

			Sybok turns to J'onn and the soldiers.

							SYBOK
					Wait outside.

			J'onn and the soldiers reluctantly withdraw. Sybok
			indicates for chairs, arranged in  circle.

							SYBOK
							(continuing)
					I'm sure you have many questions
					Here, amidst the stars of our own
					galaxy, we shall seek the answers
					together.

			The four men take their seats. The lighting becomes
			intimate. Sybok weaves his spell.

			CUT TO :

	179   INT. SICK BAY

			Scotty awakens to find Uhura holding him in her arms.

							UHURA
							(soothing)
					Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy.
					You're back with us.

							SCOTTY
							(testing her)
					Uhura, I had the strangest dream.
					I dreamt that a madman had taken
					over the Enterprise.

							UHURA
					Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.

							SCOTTY
						(realizing she's
							a convert)
					He's not?

							UHURA
					No. Sybok has simply put us in
					touch with feelings we've always
					been afraid to express.

			Uhura gives Scotty loving look.

							SCOTTY
							(uncomfortable)
					I.. er... have to get back the 
					transporter.

			Scotty slips out of her arms.

							UHURA
					No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty...
					There's so much I want to tell you.

							SCOTTY
					Maybe you could wait until I'm a
					wee bit stronger I don't think
					I could take it in my present
					condition.
						(under his breath)
					Or yours.

			Scotty heads for the exit.

	180   INT. FOWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

			Beyond the windows, the swirling vastness of space.
			Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok sit in a circle.

							SYBOK
					Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource."
					"Heaven." "Eden." call it
					"Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's
					"Vorta Vor." The Andorian word
					is.. unpronounceable. Still, every
					culture shares he common
					dream of a place from which creation
					sprang. For us, that place will
					soon be a reality.

							KIRK
					The only realty I see is that I'm
					a prisoner on my own ship. What is
					this power you have to control the
					minds of my crew?

							SYBOK
					I don't control minds. I free
					them.

							McCOY
					How?

							SYBOK
					By making you face your pain and
					draw strength from it. Once
					that's done, fear cannot stop
					you.

							McCOY
					Sounds like brainwashing to me.

			Sybok closes his eyes and concentrates deeply.

							SYBOK
						(to McCoy; sensing)
					Your pain is the deepest of all.

							McCOY
					What?

							SYBOK
					I can feel it. Can't you?

			A city skyline materializes in the background.

						MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
						(a whisper in pain)
					Leonard...

							McCOY
					It's some kind of trick.

						MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
							(imploring)
					Leonard...

							McCOY
						(as he recognizes
							the voice)
					Father?

			The surrounding walls come alive with energy. What
			follows is theatrical in style as we enter a subjective
			world.

							McCOY
						(continuing; frightened)
					Oh my God, don't do this to me.

	181   ANGLE - McCOY

			He turns to find himself in a brilliantly white, sterile
			hospital room. A wasted figure reclines in a bed, an
			old man connected to a powerful life-support system.
			This is McCOY'S FATHER and we are somewhere in the past.

							FATHER
							(barely audible)
					Leonard...

			McCoy rushes to the bedside.

							McCOY
					I'm here. I'm with you, Dad.

							FATHER
					The pain... stop the pain.

							McCOY
					I've done everything I can do.
					You've got to hang on.

							FATHER
					I can't stand the pain. Help me.

			In the near background Sybok watches with Kirk and Spock.
			They are entranced by what they're seeing.

							McCOY
					All my knowledge and I can't
					save him.

							SYBOK
							(the voice of
							conscience)
					You've done all you can. The
					support system will keep him alive.

							McCOY
							(flaring)
					You call this alive?

			Father whispers something. McCoy bends down and puts his
			ear next to the old man's parched lips.

							FATHER
					Son, release me...

			McCoy looks into his Father's eyes. The old man's gaze
			travels to the support machinery. He wants McCoy to
			shut it off.

							McCOY
							(recoiling)
					I can't do that, Dad.
							(in agony)
					But how - how can I watch him
					suffer like this?

							SYBOK
					You're a doctor.

							McCOY
							(defiant)
					I'm his son!

			McCoy reaches his decision. He shuts off the machine.
			The Father dies in his son's arms. Sybok appears at
			McCoy's side.

							SYBOK
					Why did you do it?

							McCOY
					To preserve his dignity.

							SYBOK
					That wasn't the worst of it.

							McCOY
					No.

							SYBOK
					Was it?

							McCOY
					No.

							SYBOK
					Share it.

			McCoy hesitates, trembling. This is his dark secret.

							McCOY
					Not long after... they found a
					cure. A goddamn cure!

							SYBOK
					So if you hadn't killed him he
					might have lived.

							McCOY
							(breaking down)
					No! I loved my father. I
					released him.

							SYBOK
					Then you did what you thought
					was right.

							McCOY
					Yes. No! Yes!

			Sybok holds McCoy. The CAMERA PUSHES IN as they hold
			each other.

							SYBOK
					Release this pain.. Release it.
					This pain has poisoned your soul
					for a long time.

			Kirk and Spock look at each other with concern.

			McCoy weeps for several moments, then wipes the tears
			away. He looks up at Sybok's comforting smile and is
			filled with a deep sense of relief.

							SYBOK
							(continuing)
					Now you've taken the first step.
					The other steps we'll take together.

			McCoy nods. Sybok turns to Spock.

							SYBOK
							(continuing)
					Each man's pain is unique.

							SPOCK
					I hide no pain.

							SYBOK
					I know you better than that.

							SPOCK
							(challenging)
					Do you?

							KIRK
					Spock... don't.

							SPOCK
					It's all right, Captain.
							(to Sybok)
					Proceed.

			O.S. a woman screams in agony.

	182   ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK

			They turn and find themselves beneath the hanging
			stalactites of a cave. Torchlight throws weird shadows
			on the walls. The shadows depict a woman in labor,
			attended by a Vulcan High Priestess. Ceremonial DRUMS
			pound a throbbing pulse. The woman lets out another
			scream. It reverberates throughout the cavern.

							KIRK
					What is this?

							SPOCK
					I believe we are witnessing my
					birth.

			Sybok appears beside them. He leads Spock and Kirk into
			the past.

	183   ANGLE - AS THEY APPROACH

			Spock's mother, the young earthwoman AMANDA, lies on a 
			rough pallet, her legs spread beneath her robes, her
			distended stomach lifting. Her only attendant is THE
			HIGH PRIESTESS who intones the Vulcan birthrights.

			Spock watches.

			A figure steps from the shadows. It is SAREK, Spock's
			Vulcan father. He observes his wife with typical
			detachment.

			As the DRUMS build in intensity, Amanda begins to
			deliver.

	184   ANGLE - CAVERN WALL

			The birth takes place in shadow. DRUMS reach a climax
			and stop. An infant cries. Amanda lifts the mewling
			babe from between her legs.

	185   SPOCK

			Watching his entry into the world.

	186   HIGH PRIESTESS

			She takes the baby from Amanda and holds it up. The
			tiny infant kicks and cries. Amanda reaches out for
			her child but the Priestess turns and presents the
			crying baby to Sarek instead.

							SAREK
							(without joy)
					So human.

	187   ANGLE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

			Spock turns away from Sybok and the others.

							KIRK
					Spock...
						(when he doesn't
						reply, to Sybok)
					What have you done to my friends?

							SYBOK
					I've done nothing. This is who
					they are. Didn't you know that?

			The question hits Kirk with force.

							KIRK
							(realizing)
					No... I didn't.

							SYBOK
					Now learn something about
					yourself.

							KIRK
					No. I refuse.

							McCOY
							(imploring)
					Jim, try to be open about this.

							KIRK
					About what? That I've made the
					wrong choices in my life? That I
					turned left when I should've turned
					right? I know what my weaknesses
					are. I don't need Sybok to take me
					on a tour of them.

							McCOY
					If you'd just unbend and allow
					yourself - 

							KIRK
					And be brainwashed by this con man?

							McCOY
					I was wrong. This "con man" took
					away my pain.

							KIRK
					Damnit, Bones, you're a doctor.
					You know that pain and guilt can't
					be taken away with a wave of a 
					magic wand. They're things we carry
					with us - the things that make us
					who we are. If we lost them, we
					lose ourselves. I don't want my
					pain taken away. I need my pain.

			A tense silence, broken by...

							UHURA'S VOICE
					Sybok, this is the bridge. We're
					in approach of the Great Barrier.

			Sybok is filled with excitement, eager to go to the
			bridge.

							SYBOK
					Captain, I'm afraid you'll have
					to remain here. Spock. Dr. McCoy...
					Come with me.

			Sybok and McCoy start for the exit but stop when they
			realize that Spock is remaining with Kirk.

							SYBOK
							(puzzled)
					Spock?

							SPOCK
					I cannot go with you.

							SYBOK
						(can't believe it)
					Why not?

							SPOCK
					I belong here.

							SYBOK
					I don't understand...

							SPOCK
					Sybok, you are my brother, but
					you do not know me. I am not the
					outcast boy you left behind those
					many years ago. Since that time
					I have found myself and my place.
					I know who I am. And I cannot go
					with you.

			McCoy reacts to this speech. After a moment, he takes
			his place with Kirk and Spock.

							McCOY
					I guess you better count me out,
					too.

			Beyond the great windows, space is hanging, reflecting
			this unique part of the galaxy.

			Sybok regards Kirk, Spock and McCoy with affection. This
			is only a temporary setback. He knows the ultimate win
			will be his.

							SYBOK
					Then I'll see you on the other
					side.

			Sybok heads for the exit. Doors WHOOSH open to reveal
			the guards outside.

							KIRK
					Wait!
							(Sybok turns)
					You know we'll never make it
					through the Great Barrier.

							SYBOK
					But if we do, will that convince
					you that my vision was true?

							KIRK
					Your vision?

							SYBOK
					Given to me by God.
							(as the others
							react)
					He waits for us on the other side.

							KIRK
							(stunned)
					You are mad!

							SYBOK
					Am I? We'll see.

			The fiery look in Sybok's eyes might be confidence, it
			might be madness. He turns and exits.

			CUT TO :

	188   EXT. SPACE - THE GREAT BARRIER

			Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant star
			cluster known as the Great Barrier. It is visually
			stunning and equally dangerous. We see giant regions of
			star formations as well as expanding blast waves from
			exploding stars. Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep
			the tiny and insignificant ship, bathing her in color.

	189   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN

			Sybok is on the bridge. Uhura, Chekov and Sulu are at
			their stations. Caithlin, Korrd and Talbot are also
			present. They and the rest of the crew are transfixed
			by the viewscreen, awed by the vista of a sky filled
			with thousands of stars, each a fiery orange.

			But what really draws their attention is the black
			thundercloud looming directly ahead. Here starts the
			ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of the
			galaxy, hiding it from view. Behind this black veil
			is a region that emits ten times more energy than our
			sun. Through the chinks in the wall we see flashes of
			blue light - hints of the fires blazing within.

			The hip's monitor screen goes blank.

							SULU
					They say no ship can survive this.

							SYBOK
					I say they're wrong. I say the
					danger is an illusion.

							CHEKOV
					We have no instrument readings.
					Is it there or isn't it?

							SYBOK
					Mr. Sulu... full ahead.

							SULU
					Full ahead, aye.

	190   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE

			And with that, the ship plows into the Barrier, straight
			into the dark clouds, disappearing from sight. We HOLD
			for a terrifying moment, wondering if we'll ever see
			Enterprise again.

	191   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy experience a rush of elation.
			They gaze through the window at an incredible spacescape,
			unable to deny the sensation stirring within them.
			Sybok was right.

	192   ANGLE - INSIDE THE BARRIER

			Surprisingly, there is no turbulence, no buffeting.
			The Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway
			of light and color. Then, quite suddenly, the gas
			clouds part and the ship enters a region of incredible
			calm and serenity, like the clear space at the eye of
			a hurricane.

	193   INT. BRIDGE

			Sybok rises and looks in awe at the Great Barrier.

	194   EXT. SPACE

			Dead ahead, a single planet. A planet of great beauty
			and peace. Our final destination.

	195   INT. BRIDGE

			Sybok smiles and glances around. Talbot stands in
			awe of the sight before him. CAMERA PUSHES IN on
			Caithlin's happy face.

	196   EXT. SPACE

			CAMERA PUSHES IN toward Sha Ka Ree.

							KIRK'S VOICE
					Is it possible?

	197   INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM

							SPOCK
					Fascinating.

							McCOY
					Are we dreaming?

							KIRK
					If we are, then life is a dream.

			Kirk, fascinated by the planet, moves to the antique
			ship's wheel. He absentmindedly rests his hand on it.
			His eyes are drawn to the plaque attached to the spokes
			of the wheel. On it, the charter of the Enterprise has
			been set in bronze. CAMERA MOVES IN on these words:

				"TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE"

	198   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN

			The bridge buzzes with excitement. Monitor screens
			come to life.

							CHEKOV
					Instruments are back on line.
					Incredible. There's a power scource
					emanating form the planet like
					nothing I've ever seen.

			On the viewscreen, the planet appears up close  - a
			celestial orb, cloaked by swirling white clouds. 
			QUICK SHOTS of awed reactions:

							SYBOK
					Sha Ka Ree.

							KORRD
					Qui'Tu.

							CAITHLIN
					Vorta Vor.

							TALBOT
					Eden.

			The bridge doors WHOOSH open to reveal Kirk, Spock and
			McCoy. The others turn, fearful of what he'll say or do. A
			tense moment.

							KIRK
							(to Sybok)
					About the ship...

							SYBOK
							(encouraging)
					The ship needs its Captain.

							KIRK
					No special conditions?

							SYBOK 
							(happily)
					No conditions.

							KIRK
					What makes you think I won't turn
					us around?

							SYBOK
					Because you, too, must know.

			Kirk looks at the hopeful faces around him. He feels
			the excitement of being on the verge of a great frontier,
			perhaps the greatest frontier.

							KIRK
					Well, if we're going to do it...
						(with conviction)
					... we're going to do by the
					book. Mr. Chekov, you take the
					con. Mr. Sulu, standard orbital
					approach. Uhura, alert the
					shuttlecraft to stand by. Sybok,
					Spock, Dr. McCoy - come with me.
					The rest of you remain on board
					until I determine what we're
					dealing with.

			Kirk's eyes flash with excitement. To Sybok:

							KIRK
						(continuing; with
							a smile.)
					Well, don't just stand there.
					God's a busy man.

			Sybok happily joins them in the turbolift.

			CUT TO :

	200   EXT. ENTERPRISE

			Bay doors open. Copernicus, the shuttle backup, emerges
			and drops from the mothership. Thrusters fire as it
			streaks toward the planet, disappearing into the swirling
			white clouds.

	201   INT. COPERNICUS

			Spock pilots the craft. He, McCoy and Kirk have changed
			into Starfleet uniforms.

	202   THROUGH WINDSHEILD - PLANET BELOW

			Clouds part as if swept aside by hand. Beneath the
			shuttle a world opens up that can only be described
			as incredible.

	203   INT. COPERNICUS

			Sybok, Kirk, McCoy and Spock remain focused ahead,
			awestruck.

	204   EXT. PLANET

			Copernicus skims over a rich abundant landscape awash
			with bright primary colors.

	205   INT. COPERNICUS

			Spock removes his hands from the console.

							SPOCK
					I am no longer in control of the
					craft.

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy regard each other with wary
			excitement, then turn their attentions to what lies ahead.

	206   EXT. PLANET - POV SHOT

			A circle of peaks appears in the distance, rising against
			the sky.

	207   INT. COPERNICUS

			Sybok smiles at the others.

	208   EXT. PLANET

			Copernicus comes in for a soft landing.

	209   INT. COPERNICUS

			Engines switch off. Kirk slips a communicator into his
			belt. He's about to pick up a hand phaser when he feels
			Sybok's disapproving eye upon him.

							KIRK
					All right. We'll play it your
					way.

			He leaves the weapon behind.

	210   EXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE

			The exit hatch opens. Our four explorers emerge from
			the craft. They regard the prehistoric peaks with
			excitement.

							SYBOK
					It's amazing. The land... the
					sky... just as I knew it would be.

			They urgently start forward with Kirk leading the way.

	211   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Crew members abandon their posts and move forward to
			the viewscreen.

	212   EXT. PEAKS AND CRATER WITHIN - HIGH ANGLE SHOT

			Four tiny figures pass through the peaks and look down
			into a naturally formed amphitheater. It's nothing
			more than a rough crater carved in the summit, ringed
			by the peaks.

	213   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Uhura, eyes fixed on the viewscreen, speaks urgently
			into her speaker.

							UHURA
					Scotty, you've got to see this.

	214   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOOM

			Scotty is hard at work.

							SCOTTY
					I don't have the time. The Captain
					told me to get this transporter
					working and I'm not about to let
					him down.

	215   EXT. PLANET

			Kirk walks around the base of the tall peak as the CAMERA
			PULLS BACK

	216   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			While the crew marvels at the viewscreen, CAMERA PANS
			over to the defense station which is unattended.

			The screen blinks to life. A graphic of the Bird of
			Prey appears and a warning; "KLINGON VESSEL IN
			QUADRANT. RECOMMEND: ACTIVATION OF DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
			AWAITING COMMAND." A low warning BEEP. But no one's
			there to respond.

	217   EXT. AMPHITHEATER

			Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok descend into the bowl of
			the crater. They reach the center and stop. They 
			look at each other, wondering, "Is this all there is?"
			Sybok tries to hide his disappointment. He looks around
			for a sign that isn't there, then, after a moment of
			deafening silence, he addresses their bleak surroundings.

							SYBOK
						(shouting; a trace
							of desperation)
			We have traveled far by starship...

			Nothing. It looks like a bust. Sybok's voice chokes
			off and he lowers his head. Kirk and McCoy frown at
			each other. Kirk whips out his communicator to address
			the ship.

							KIRK
					Enterprise, this is Kirk. We
					have, er...

			Spock goes to Sybok and puts a comforting hand on his
			brother's shoulder.

							SPOCK
					Sybok, perhaps, er...

			Spock's words are obscured by a rumble from within the
			earth. A shadow engulfs the amphitheater.

	218   ANGLE - THE SKY ABOVE

			Clouds turn ashen and threatening, transforming day
			into night.

	219   AMPHITHEATER

			The ground comes to life beneath the feet of our
			hero's. The earth buckles and ripples as if nature
			herself were trying to break free.

			Without warning a pillar of sheer rock rips through
			the surface and climbs skyward. Then another pillar
			shoots up, followed by another and another. They
			encircle the amphitheater like giant fingers. We
			INTERCUT Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sybok reacting to this
			dazzling display of power.

	220   EXT. AMPHITHEATER - WIDE SHOT

			The fingers of rock form a crude cathedral.

	221   INT. AMPHITHEATER

			Within this primitive cathedral, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and
			Sybok watch as the ground in front of them melts like
			molten lava. It swirls, creating a vortex. A RUSHING
			SOUND comes from the planet's core, growing closer.
			Something of incredible power is on its way to the
			surface.

	222   ANGLE

			A shaft of energy EXPLODES out of the vortex. It
			shoots skyward like an erupting power, blinding our
			heroes with its beauty and raw power.

	223   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - PLANET AND ENTERPRISE

			The energy shaft rises from the planet like a beacon
			light. Enterprise, just outside the shaft, is bathed
			in its reflection.

	224   INT. AMPHITHEATER

			Sybok staggers back. Like Kirk, Spock and McCoy, he
			must shield his eyes from the intensity of the energy
			shaft.

	225   ENERGY SHAFT

			It pulsates and throbs with life. A GOD-LIKE VOICE
			comes from within.

							VOICE
					Brave souls. Welcome.

			Startled reactions.

							McCOY
							(hushed)
					Is this the voice of God?

			As if responding to McCoy's question, the energy shaft
			throbs. From the swirling dust within it, a living form
			begins to take shape. The shape is powerful, beautiful,
			enticing.

			Sybok and the others watch in wonder. The wind it kicks
			up causes them to stagger back.

	226   CLOSER ANGLE - ENERGY SHAFT

			Within this maelstrom of power, the form of humanity
			begins to take shape. And it takes on many forms, each
			reminding us of the holy paintings that have depicted
			the Almighty through the ages.

							VOICE
					One voice. Many faces.

	227   A SERIES OF SHOTS

			We INTERCUT between the shifting images of God and
			the reactions of the Enterprise crew. One moment the
			figure is Ra. The next, Allah. He's black. White.
			Female. Male. Andorian. Klingon. Each witness a
			flash of his own God.

	228   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

			They watch the "God Show" with mounting fascination.

	229   ENERGY SHAFT

			The Being synthesizes into the Biblical Heavenly Father
			of our imagination. (Note: The Being is contained
			within the perimeters of the energy shaft, unable to
			venture out of it.)

			The Being turns his gaze on Sybok, Kirk, Spock and
			McCoy. He beams with pleasure. His eyes twinkle.

							BEING
					Does this better suit your
					expectations?

			It does indeed. No one knows what to say. Sybok is
			vindicated; he can barely contain his ecstasy.

							SYBOK
					Qual se tu?

							BEING
					It is I.
							(pause)
					The journey you undertook to reach
					me could not have been an easy one.

							SYBOK
					It was not. The Barrier stood
					between us - but we breached it.

							BEING
					Magnificent. You are the first to
					find me.

							SYBOK
					We sought only your infinite wisdom.

							BEING
					And how did you breach the Barrier?

							SYBOK
					With a starship!

							BEING
					This starship, could it carry my
					wisdom beyond the Barrier?

							SYBOK
					It could. Yes.

							BEING
					Then I shall make use of this
					starship.

							SYBOK
							(thrilled)
					It will be your chariot!

			Kirk politely raises his hand.

							KIRK
					Excuse me.

							BEING
							(ignoring Kirk)
					It will carry my power to every
					corner of creation...

							KIRK
							(insistent)
					Excuse me.

			The Being regards Kirk like he was a pesky insect.

							KIRK
							(continuing)
					I'd just like to ask a question.

			McCoy looks at Kirk like he just farted in church.

							KIRK
							(continuing)
					What does God need with a starship?

			The Being returns his attention to Sybok.

							BEING
					Bring the ship closer.

							KIRK
					I said... what does God need with
					a starship?

							McCOY
					Jim, what are you doing?

							KIRK
					I'm asking a question.

			The Being once again regards Kirk. Kirk stands his ground.

							BEING
					Who is this creature?

							KIRK
					Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't
					you God?

			The smile leaves The Being's face. THUNDER RUMBLES
			faintly in the distance, underscoring his displeasure.

							SYBOK
					He has his doubts...

							BEING
					You doubt me?

							KIRK
					I seek proof.

							McCOY
					Jim, you don't ask the Almighty
					for his I.D.

							BEING
					Then here is the proof that you
					seek.

			A bolt of energy shoots from The Being's eye and strikes
			Kirk full in the chest, knocking him to the ground.
			Spock and McCoy look on in shock as Kirk, injured, tries
			to rise.

	230   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			The crew can't comprehend this turn of events. Korrd,
			Caithlin and Talbot look at each other in horror.

	231   BACK TO AMPHITHEATER

							KIRK
							(to Sybok)
					Why.. is God... angry?

			Sybok is confounded. He addresses The Being.

							SYBOK
					Why? Why have you done this to
					my friend?

							BEING
					He doubts me.

			Spock takes it upon himself to step forward.

							SPOCK
					You have not answered his question.
					What does God need with a starship?

			The Being's countenance turns dark. Another bolt shoots
			from his eye and heads for Spock. CRASH! Spock is
			knocked to the ground.

			The Being turns to McCoy.

							BEING
					Do you doubt me?

			McCoy looks at The Being's handiwork - his injured friends.

							McCOY
					I doubt any God who inflicts pain
					for his own pleasure.

			The Being is on the verge of zapping McCoy when Sybok
			interrupts.

							SYBOK
					Stop! The God of Sha Ka Ree would
					not do this!

			By way of reply, The Being smiles a truly wicked smile
			and Sybok realizes to his horror that he's been tricked.

							BEING
					Sha Ka Ree?
						(scornful laugh)
					A vision you created. An eternity
					I've been imprisoned in this place!
					The ship! I must have the ship!
					Now give me what I want!

			Spock shouts to his brother.

							SPOCK
					Sybok - this is not the God of
					Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!

							SYBOK
					I don't understand..
							(to The Being)
					Reveal yourself to me!

	232   ANGLE - THE BEING

			Before our stunned eyes The Being changes into Sybok
			himself - a dark, sinister reflection of Sybok. This Evil
			Sybok laughs, enjoying the reaction.

							BEING
							(laughs)
					What's wrong? Don't you like this
					face? I have so many. But this
					one suits you best.

	233   ANGLE TO INCLUDE SYBOK

			His self-realization is painful to behold.

							SYBOK
					No, no, it's not possible.

							BEING
					Bring me the ship or I will
					destroy you!

							SYBOK
						(realizing The Being's
						evil intention)
					The ship....

							BEING
					Bring it closer so that I might
					join with it. Do it, or watch
					these puny things die horribly.

			The Being indicates Spock and McCoy.

							SYBOK
					What have I done?

							KIRK
					(into his communicator)
					Kirk to Enterprise. Listen
					carefully...

							SYBOK
						(turns to Spock;
							in agony)
					Spock...

							SPOCK
							(urgently)
					Sybok.

							SYBOK
						(soul searching)
					This is my doing. This is my
					arrogance... my vanity...

							SPOCK
					Sybok, we must find a way...

							SYBOK
							(interrupting)
					No. You must save yourselves.
					Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

			Sybok raises his hand to Spock in the Vulcan gesture of
			farewell, then turns to face The Being, gathering up all
			his power. Spock starts forward but Kirk holds him back.


	234   ANGLE - THE BEING AND SPOCK

			Sybok has no fear as he confronts his evil mirror image.

							SYBOK
					(continuing; to The Being)
					I couldn't help but notice you
					pain.

							BEING
						(caught off-guard)
					My pain?

							SYBOK
					It runs deep. Share it with me.

			Sybok boldly enters the shaft and embraces his evil twin.

	235   ANGLE - ENERGY HAFT

			An amazing spectacle. As they grapple, the good and evil
			Syboks merge into one twisting, thrashing body, clearly
			at battle with itself. The good Sybok tears himself
			loose. He dominates the struggle until the evil Sybok
			manages to rip through and fight back. The two Syboks,
			good and evil, battle on... merging, tearing again.

							KIRK
						(into communicator)
					Enterprise... are you ready?

	236   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Sulu and Chekov in action. Sulu uses all the tricks
			of the pilot's trade to angle the ship into the best
			possible attack position.

			Chekov punches commands into the weapons console,
			plotting the correct torpedo trajectory. It's like
			watching two master magicians play a symphony in a
			windstorm. The screens in front of them blink and
			flash with graphic displays and warnings.

							SULU
					In firing position. Torpedo
					armed.

							CHEKOV
					But, Captain, we're firing
					directly on your position.

	237   BACK TO PLANET

			Sybok continues to grapple with his evil twin.

							KIRK
					Send it down, Mr. Chekov. Now!

	238   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRIE AND ENERGY SHAFT

			A photo torpedo leaves the dish and streaks forward.

	239   ANGLE

			CAMERA CHASES the torpedo down the shaft and into the
			hole.

							KIRK
					Run! Go!

	240   INT. AMPHITHEATER

			Impact is seconds away. Kirk, Spock and McCoy run for
			cover. From far beneath the surface of the planet
			comes the SOUND of the EXPLOSION. The ground blisters
			and puckers.

	241   AMPHITHEATER - LONG SHOT

			Our heroes dive for cover as a BLINDING EXPLOSION erupts
			from the hole.

	242   INT. AMPHITHEATER

			Smoke. Debris. The cathedral is in disarray. An
			eerie silence. Kirk, Spock and McCoy emerge from cover.
			The energy shaft is a memory. In its place there is
			only a gaping hole, glowing raw and red like a wound.

							SPOCK
							(softly)
					Sybok...

			A RUMBLING SOUND from within the earth. The hole
			throbs. It pulsates.

							KIRK
							(worried)
					We've got to get out of here.

	243   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY

			They haul ass up the side of the amphitheater.

	244   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			Chekov and Sulu still at work at the console.

							UHURA
					Sulu, I've lost them.

			They desperately try to locate Kirk, Spock and McCoy on
			the planet below.

	245   ANGLE - DEFENSE STATION

			The unattended screen still depicts the Bird of Prey.
			"ESTIMATED TIME OF INTERCEPT: 4 MINUTES." Then,
			the graphic of the ship vanishes and is replaced with
			this warning: "CLOAKING DEVICE ENGAGED. POSITION
			UNKNOWN."

	246   EXT. AMPHITHEATER

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy reach the top and rush to
			Copernicus.

	247   INT. COPERNICUS

			Kirk, Spock and McCoy make it inside. The door closes
			behind them.

							KIRK
					Spock, get us out of here!

			Before Spock can act a tremendous blow rocks the shuttle.
			There's something out there and it wants to get in. 
			Spock tries the controls.

							SPOCK
					Thrusters are inoperative.

			Kirk whips out his communicator.

							KIRK
					Mr. Scott!

							SCOTTY'S VOICE
					Scotty here, sir.

							KIRK
					Please tell me the transporter is
					working.

	248   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM

							SCOTTY
					She's got partial power, sir. I
					might be able to take two of you.

	249   INT. COPERNICUS

							KIRK
						(into communicator)
					Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy.
					Now!

			Before Spock and McCoy can protest, the transporter beam
			shimmers down and takes them away.

							McCOY
					Now just a damn min...

			Spock and McCoy vanish in a glow of light as they are
			beamed up.

	250   INT. ENTERPRISE -  TRANSPORTER ROOM

			Spock and McCoy step off the platform. Scotty is at
			the control console.

							SPOCK
					Thank you, Mr. Scott. Beam up
					the Captain.

							SCOTTY
					Aye-aye.

	251   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE - ENTERPRISE AND BIRD OF PREY

			The Klingon ship has decloaked and fired from a position
			directly in front of the Enterprise. In cowboy terms, it's
			got the drop on them.

	252   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM

			Enterprise absorbs a terrific jolt. Spock, McCoy and
			Scotty go flying as the transporter EXPLODES in a
			shower of sparks.

	253   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON BIRD OF PREY

			Firing.

	254   INT. COPERNICUS

			Kirk turns to see another BLINDING EXPLOSION. He
			looks frightened; realizes he's not going to be
			beamed up.

	255   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

			The crew painfully pulls itself together. Fires are
			put out. Auxiliary power comes on. Spock, McCoy and
			Scotty enter.

							McCOY
							(to Spock)
					What about Jim? We can't just
					leave him down there.

							SPOCK
							(stoic)
					Please get a grip on yourself,
					Doctor.
							(to Uhura)
					Status report.

							UHURA
					Klingon Captain wishes to name
					his terms, Mr. Spock.

							SPOCK
					On screen.

			Klaa appears on the veiwscreen, arms folded across his
			chest, seated triumphantly in his command chair. He
			speaks English for the first time.

							KLAA'S IMAGE
					This is Captain Klaa of the
					Klingon Empire. Attempt to raise
					shields or arm weapons and I will
					destroy you. You are alive for a
					single reason. The renegade James
					T. Kirk. Hand him over and I will
					spare your lives. My transporter
					stands ready to beam him aboard.

							SPOCK
					Captain Kirk is not among us.

							KLAA'S IMAGE
					You lie!

							SPOCK
					I'm a Vulcan. I'm incapable of
					lying. Captain Kirk is on the
					planet below.

							KLAA'S IMAGE
					Then give me his coordinates!

			Spock glimpses a possibility. He turns to Korrd and
			speaks with urgency.

							SPOCK
					General, I am in need of your
					assistance.

							KORRD
							(scoffing)
					My assistance?

							SPOCK
					You are his superior officer.

							KORRD
					I am a foolish old man.

							SPOCK
					Damn you, sir, you will try!

			Korrd sees that Spock will not take no for an answer.

			CUT TO :

	256   EXT. SPACE

			The Bird of Prey flies toward the Enterprise.

							SPOCK'S VOICE
					Klingon Commander, someone wishes
					to speak with you.

	257   EXT. PEAKS - PLANET

			Kirk scrambles from one hiding place to another.

	258   PINNACLE

			With nowhere to go but up, Kirk scales a steep pinnacle.
			He climbs with agility and speed.

	259   WIDE ANGLE SHOT

			Kirk climbs up as a bolt of light hits the rock before
			him. The blue light and smoke of The Being pulsates
			from the rocky face of the mountain. The eyes of The
			Being glow white.

			There's a WHOOSHING SOUND from above. Kirk looks up.

	260   ANGLE -  SKY ABOVE

			The Bird of Prey drops out of the storm clouds. Its
			guns come to life and strafe the rock creature.

	261   KIRK

			Vulnerable atop the pinnacle. The Bird of Prey hovers
			directly above him, its guns swiveling in his direction.
			Kirk is determined to go down fighting.

							KIRK
						(shouting in defiance)
					So it's me you want, you Klingon
					bastards! What are you waiting
					for?!

			The Bird of Prey's transporter beam shimmers down and
			engulfs him. Kirk disappears in its sparkling light,
			saved from The Being who lets out an angry roar of
			defeat. The Bird of Prey takes off with its prize.

	262   INT. BIRD OF PREY - TRANSPORTER ROOM

			Kirk materializes. He's immediately seized by two
			brutal-looking Klingons. They march him out of the
			transporter room.

	263   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

			The bridge doors slide open and Kirk is brought in.
			The Klingon crew regard him from their stations.
			Klaa is off to one side looking petulant. Korrd stands
			beside him, chest puffed up with pride, obviously in
			charge.

							KORRD
						(to the guards)
					Release him.

			The guards step away from Kirk. Klaa glares at Korrd
			but it's clear the older Klingon is now calling the
			shots.

			Kirk regards Korrd with surprise.

							KORRD
							(continuing)
					Kirk, my junior officer has
					something he wants to say to you.
						(speaks to Klaa in Klingon.)

							KLAA
					I apologize.

			Korrd speaks to Klaa in Klingon once again.

							KLAA
							(continuing)
					The attack upon your vessel was
					not authorized by my government.

							KORRD
					Kirk, and now, may I present our
					new gunner.

			The command chair swivels around to reveal its occupant
			to be Spock. He unstraps himself from the gunner's rig,
			stands up and straightens his uniform in a dignified
			manner.

							KIRK
					Spock?

							SPOCK
					Welcome aboard, Captain.

			Kirk regards the stoic Spock with affection and wonder.

							KIRK
						(can't believe it)
					Spock, I thought I was going to
					die.

							SPOCK
					Not possible. You were never
					alone.

			Kirk fights back tears and clasps his friend in a hug.
			Spock stiffens with embarrassment.

							SPOCK
							(continuing)
					Please, Captain, not in front of
					the Klingons.

			Kirk laughs and hugs him all the harder. Spock tentatively
			hugs him back.

			CUT TO :

	264   EXT. SPACE

			Enterprise and Bird of Prey are side by side, in orbit
			around the planet.

	265   INT. ENTERPRISE - FORWARD OBSERVATION ROOM - ANGLE ON
			KORRD

			The Klingon polishes off a tumbler of fluid. He frowns.
			What he wants is a real drink. Scotty approaches him.

							SCOTTY
					Would you care for a wee nip of
					Scotch whiskey?

							KORRD
					Ummmm...

			Scotty produces a bottle and pours a splash into the
			Klingon's tumbler. Korrd downs it with obvious relish.
			Scotty smiles.

							SCOTTY
					I never thought I'd ever be drinking
					with a Klingon, heh?

			Korrd chortles agreeably and moves off. We FOLLOW him
			over to Talbot and Caithlin.

							KORRD
					What are you two conspiring
					about?

							TALBOT
					We were just saying how far we've
					come in such a short space of time.

							KORRD
					We certainly have.

	266   ANGLE - SULU AND CHEKOV

			The doors slide open and Vixis, Sulu and Chekov enter
			the room, Vixis leading the way.

							CHEKOV
							(re Vixis)
					She has wonderful muscles.

	267   ANGLE - KLAA

			Vixis walks to Klaa. When they see him, Chekov and
			Sulu suddenly stop and turn away. Klaa waves off a
			waiter who offers him a drink. He approaches a table
			where Kirk sits talking to crewmen. Klaa gives him
			the Klingon chest-thumping salute.

	268   ANGLE - KIRK

			With a smile, Kirk returns the Klingon salute.

			He notices Spock and McCoy standing at the window,
			staring out, oblivious to the party around them. Kirk
			approaches.

							KIRK
					Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?

							McCoy
					We were speculating.
							(staring out)
					... is God really out there?

							KIRK
					Maybe he's not out there, Bones.
					Maybe he's right here... in the 
					human heart
						(noticing Spock's
						distant expression)
					Spock?

							SPOCK
					I was thinking of Sybok. I've
					lost a brother.

							KIRK
					Yes. I lost a brother once.
					I was lucky. I got him back.

							McCOY
					I thought you said men like us 
					don't have families.

							KIRK
					I was wrong.

			CAMERA PUSHES IN on them as the three men smile their
			understanding at one another and we slowly...

			DISSOLVE TO :

	269   EXT. YOSEMITE - NIGHT

			CAMERA PULLS BACK from a roaring campfire. McCoy pours
			two cups full of bourbon and hands one to Kirk who
			sets aside his marshmallow on a stick. Kirk and McCoy
			clink cups in a silent toast and drink, distracted by
			strange PLINKING SOUNDS from close by. Spock is
			revealed, absently strumming his Vulcan lute, in search
			of a tune.

							KIRK
							(with a smile)
					Are you just going to sit there
					and pluck that thing? Or are
					you going to play something?

			The plinks and plunks gradually become a tune. The
			unmistakable "Row Your Boat." Kirk and McCoy react with
			delight. Kirk takes a hit of bourbon and clears his
			throat.

							KIRK
							(singing)
					"Row, row, row your boat, gently
					down the stream, merrily, merrily,
					merrily, merrily, life is but a
					dream."
							(repeats)

			Spock jumps in.

							SPOCK
						(singing; overlapping)
					"Row, row, row your boat, gently
					down the stream, merrily, merrily,
					merrily, merrily, life is but a
